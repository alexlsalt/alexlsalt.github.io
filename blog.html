        <h3>Make Time to Make Time</h3>
          <h4>February 6, 2020</h4>
          <p>
            Yesterday I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK-sZjuXA6A" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that was serendipitously recommended to me on my feed. I started to think about the idea of 'making time.' <br><br> 
            Making time to take care of ourselves, making time to cook high-quality meals, making time to sit down and learn or code in a highly focused manner - instead of flying by and trying to get everything done in a 30-miniute time slot.
            <br><br>
            This idea is great motivation for not simply checking every little thing off the to-do list in a very half-assed and not full committed way, but instead, accomplishing bigger tasks that move the needle in a more significant way. 
            <br><br>
            Along that same line, here's an excerpt I really love from Jason Fried's <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/compounding-time/" target="_blank">post</a> on the Signal vs Noise blog:
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">There are lots of ways to carve up an hour. 10 x 6. 15 x 4. 30 x 2. 45 + 15. 20 + 20 + 20. The key is not to carve it up. And when you stack it up – one full hour after another – you really see the compound benefits of uninterrupted time. </p><br>
          <p>I love the idea of being able to fully complete any tasks we have on our plates by leveraging the power of truly uninterrupted time. I'm thinking of a task that we fear will take us the entire day, and then when we sit down to focus solely on that project, it ends up taking a true fraction of the expected time.<br><br>
          It really all starts with being mindful, and making the time, to do our best work and live our most enjoyable lives.

        <h3>Refactoring My Tip Calculator Program</h3>
          <h4>February 5, 2020</h4>
          <p>In one of my exercises from my JS course yesterday, we had to create an object, <code>john</code>, representing a person and the number and prices of meals he had on vacation and how much he tipped with each meal. According to instructions, he preferred to tip as follows: <br><br>
            - For meals less than $50, tip 20% <br>
            - For meals between $50 and $200, tip 15% <br>
            - For meals over $200, tip 10% (I know - I wouldn't want to be John's server either.) <br><br>

            Here's the code I started off with for calculating both the individual tips he gave for each meal, as well as each total meal cost (cost of meal with tip included): </p><br><br>
            <pre>
              <code>
      var john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          var tip;
          var totalMealCost;
          
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            var bill = this.bills[i];
            if (bill > 0 && bill < 50) {
              tip = bill * 0.2;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              tip = bill * 0.15;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else {
              tip = bill * 0.1;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } 
          this.tips.push(tip);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
          } 
        }
      };
              </code>
            </pre><br><br>
            <p>
              And then after some refactoring, this is my final program (manually transpiled from ES5 to ES6):
            </p>
            
            <br><br>
            <pre>
              <code>
      const john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          let totalMealCost;
          let tipAmount;
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            let bill = this.bills[i];
            let percentage;
             if (bill < 50) {
              percentage = 0.2;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              percentage = 0.15;
            } else {
              percentage = 0.1;
            } 
          
          tipAmount = bill * percentage;
          totalMealCost = bill + tipAmount;

          this.tips.push(tipAmount);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
           } 
         }
       };
              </code>
            </pre><br><br>
          <p>
            The main thing here is the fact that I removed the tipAmount and totalMealCost variables from each tipping condition and moved them instead to the end of the for loop. <br><br>
            
            I'm working more on not repeating myself in my code, and I'm realizing that it all comes down to practicing and eventually reaching higher skill levels - after a certain amount of time, thinking about how your own code could be improved becomes as natural as anything.

          <h3>The Power of Learning Over and Over Again</h3>
          <h4>February 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>
            I'm always overjoyed when something that I've been working on mastering/learning for some time finally settles in with that ephemeral <em>click.</em><br><br>

            Today I finished up the Basics section of my JavaScript course, and I'm very proud to say that I flew through it with soaring colors. I wish I could go back to my past self when she was just settling in to trying to figure out what JavaScript was, tap her on the shoulder, and let her know that everything was going to come full circle and click one of these days.<br><br>

            The secret is in putting in the effort day after day after day, even (and especially) when things aren't making sense. It takes learning something (like rock-solid JS foundations) over and over again before the concepts will seem familiar and - dare I say - enjoyable.<br><br>

            Proudest moments of the day:<br><br>
        
            - Fully understanding the use of the this keyword in multiple exercises <br>
            - Writing a solid, functional tip-calculating program from objects and methods
          </p>
          <br><br>
        
          <h3>A Blog is Born</h3>
          <h4>February 3, 2020</h4>
          <p>
            Here it is - the first official post of my self-developed portfolio and blog site! I'm still trying to wrap my head around dynamically rendering blog posts, so for now, I'm (embarrassingly) statically rendering them within the blog.html page. I feel like I'm on the brink of an idea and it involves pushing posts into an array that renders through DOM manipulation on the page. I know it would be a breeze with React or Gatsby, but for now I'm trying to focus solely on JS.<br><br>

            Speaking of which - I started in today on a JavaScript course on Udemy. I always love the beginnings of any JS lessons, books, etc. I'm pretty aware of how far I've come and I love being able to complete all the exercises with relative ease. Looking forward to spending these next couple of weeks focused on that and continuing to strengthen my JS foundation.<br><br>

            I'm hoping to document at least every day or two. I recently shipped a new side project - <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/three-todos/" target="_blank">Three To-Do's A Day</a>. I'll be updating some features and interactivity over the next few weeks, but I just love that feeling of publishing something (even when it's not completely perfect).
