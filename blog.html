          <h3>Pushing Through Resistance to Practice Coding Challenges</h3>
          <h4>May 8, 2020</h4>
          <p>Alright, folks. We've made it to the end of the week. And it's actually been really calm!
            <br><br>
            I'm at about the halfway point of my client web design project where I'll be finishing up the first draft of it and sending it over to my client and her virtual assistant for review. Then I'll have a nice, restful weekend.
            <br><br>
            I mentioned yesterday that I wanted to start practicing live coding technical challenges. But I didn't get around to it, and toward the end of the day, I noticed myself feeling really tense and edgy.
            <br><br>
            I think I got caught up in a mind-whirl of "Well I don't know how to do this so I'm just better off putting it off indefinitely."
            <br><br>
            Which...doesn't help very much.
            <br><br>
            Thankfully, those feelings were assuaged by talking it through and going for a long evening walk.
            <br><br>
            But today's a new day, and I've made the decision to start my work by actually setting a timer and working through a coding challenge. Regardless of whether or not I'm successful with it, I'll still be a bit closer to where I eventually want to be (instead of staying at Point Zero by not doing anything at all).
            <br><br>
            Just like compound interest - showing up and making small consistent efforts over time result in exponential growth. That's the ultimate move - here we go.
          </p><br><br> 


          <h3>We've Arrived at the Bridge - Now, Cross!</h3>
          <h4>May 7, 2020</h4>
          <p>Thursday, Thursday, Thursday! Last night, I attended a great webinar put on by Twilio where participants got to try their hand at a live coding exercise via HackerRank. 
            <br><br>
            Honestly, it was actually my first time doing that, and it was challenging - in a good way! I learned a lot afterward about best practices during the debrief from the host, Corey, and it really inspired me to start practicing with those timed coding exercises.
            <br><br>
            In fact, practicing live/timed coding exercises has always been one of those things at the back of my mind in an "I'll cross that bridge when I come to it" kind of way, and now I'm definitely thinking that I've come to that bridge lol.
            <br><br>
            I think I'll probably set myself up to do a few practice rounds each week. It's just something that I'm going to have to sit down, set a timer, and *do*.
            <br><br>
            That being said, I'm becoming more and more conscious of my tendency to shy away from new things that I don't know how to do because my underlying thought is that 'I don't know how.' 
            <br><br>
            Looking back, it has been one of the determining factors in leading to procrastinating on important things in my life, but I'm realizing more and more that if I just purposefully work to switch the script and tell myself that the only way I'll eventually know *how* to do it is if I jump in and start practicing and getting experience with it!
            <br><br>
            Well, folks, we've made it to the bridge ... let's cross!
          </p><br><br> 

          <h3>Step Away from the 'Should' to Embrace the 'What If'</h3>
          <h4>May 6, 2020</h4>
          <p>I woke up with amazing news today! Can't share directly right now (I know, the frustration!) but just know that I'm feeling GÜD.
            <br><br>
            From some Pinterest browsing this morning, I took a break from my regularly-scheduled gallery-wall and sprawling-cottage-garden inspiration to fall in love with this sweet quote (author unknown): </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">
              You gotta start romanticizing your life. <br><br>
              You gotta start believing that your morning commute is cute and fun, that every cup of coffee is the best you’ve ever had, that even the smallest and most mundane things are exciting and new. 
              <br><br>
              You have to, because that’s when you start truly living. That’s when you look forward to every day.<br><br>
            </p><br>
            <p>
            I seriously love this. Consciously recognizing each moment as unique and exciting has been *the* deciding factor for me in living an amazing life. <br><br>
            The fact that our experiences are shaped directly by our thoughts and that we can learn to cultivate our thoughts to have a more optimistic (or inversely, negative) bent is simply mind-blowing.
            <br><br>
            I love this time in my life - learning, growing, gracefully stepping away from the 'should' to embrace the 'what if.'
            <br><br>
            And it's only just getting started.
          </p><br><br>

          <h3>Productive Yet Languorous</h3>
          <h4>May 5, 2020</h4>
          <p>Another day! I had another pleasant realization last night at around 9pm that this week is très laidback. It feels so nice to not have something pressing to do at every minute of the day and evening!
            <br><br>
            While I have my client project - with steady progress each day, there's no need for stress or rushing things out the door. I wish I could go back to my past self (high school, college, etc) and teach her how to complete tasks and assignments gradually and pleasurably instead of waiting until the last minute and inevitably dreading the experience.
            <br><br>
            In somewhat related news, I've been doing a lot of personal development work during this period of COVID confinement - with meditation, thought work, and tuning in to helpful podcasts - and it has just made me realize how much progress I've made, as well as how much interesting work there still is to do! 
          </p><br><br>

          <h3>New Week, New Project</h3>
          <h4>May 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Monday, folks! After a relatively productive-yet-relaxing weekend, I'm ready for this new week - complete with the start of a new client web design project!
            <br><br>
          It's been a minute since I've done client work, and I'm actually really excited to get back into it for this project. It's going to be a simple transfer of the site from Wordpress to Squarespace, but with some custom JavaScript code thrown in by yours truly. Really looking forward to the process.
            <br><br>
          Other than that, this week should be pretty laidback with a couple of life-admin tasks to take care of! Yay! 
            <br><br>
          Hope this week is great for you as well! Cheers.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>My First Hackathon Submission: Success!!!</h3>
          <h4>May 1, 2020</h4>
          <p>Wow-ZA. The last couple of days have been *intense* to say the very least. Over the past two-ish weeks, I've been steadily moving forward with my very first hackathon project, Wellbean. 
            <br><br>
          I can't even begin to count the number of times I went back and forth about if, when, or how I was going to finish the project after coming up against so many confusion headaches and roadblocks.
            <br><br>
          Well, my friends, I'm elated to say that I submitted my project yesterday in a neat little package à la a blog post on dev.to which you can find right over <a href="https://dev.to/alexlsalt/wellbean-the-finished-product-x-twilio-hackathon-1o3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here >></a>
          <br><br>
          And here's a quick demo of the project:
          </p><br>
          <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/36e0660de36f42f2aedb9623bab1876b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
          <br>
          <p>*Huge breath of relief and satisfaction...* I am so, so happy! Now, may the weekend commence with joyful relaxation, lots of reading, and some low-key question-answering for an awesome apprenticeship application. Cheers!</p>
          </p><br><br>
          
          <h3>Roadblocks and a Big Mindset Shift</h3>
          <h4>April 28, 2020</h4>
          <p>Okay. So I'm definitely facing a depletion in motivation from before. I spent a large part of the yesterday hung up and going around and around in circles on how to implement a Twilio API into my wellbean app to gather information from the database itself.
            <br><br>
          Now, after coming up against so many dead ends, I'm wondering if I should just hook up the API in a very basic 'Welcome, here are instructions for getting started with wellbean...' way.
            <br><br>
          Luckily, I have a virtual meetup tonight where I'm going to work on the app and hopefully talk through this roadblock with other coding ladies.
            <br><br>
          The thing is, though - as much as I want to submit this project to the hackathon with the full Twilio functionality, I *also* need to stay aware of the fact that even if I don't end up submitting it, I still have an absolutely epic project I've built up from scratch!
          <br><br>
          I learned and set up Firebase! I learned how to set up user accounts and databases! I finally learned how to use CSS Grid! Seriously, that's already more than amazing!
          <br><br>
          My plan for today is to spend some time learning about setting up Firebase Rules for data privacy and then implementing that into my app.
          <br><br>
          I may also work on a color/time function for wellbean to keep track of who needs to be contacted based on how much time has passed. I started in on it yesterday, but it needs a little bit more tinkering around :)
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>A Great Epiphany</h3>
          <h4>April 27, 2020</h4>
          <p>Mondaaaay! I had an awesome weekend, especially with the epiphany that hit me over the head with my wellbean project!
            <br><br>
            Basically, after I was chasing my mind around in circles, I realized I was majorly overcomplicating everything. Here I was, torturing myself trying to make an entire, full-service application. I was coming up against so many weird scope issues, so I finally stopped myself and consciously wondered what this would all look like if it were easy?
            <br><br>
            Just from that musing, something instinctively clicked in my brain, and I realized that I *only* need to build the functionality so that it works in a local environment. In other words, I didn't need to worry about getting users' profiles all built out and pulling their information across different channels just so the app worked.
            <br><br>
            I only needed to lay out the instructions for getting the app to work on anyone's own machine (i.e. leave all the data-pulling out of it on my end, and allow users to use the app based on their own Twilio account and data).
            <br><br>
            Seriously, such a relief! Instead of entering this week as a wired bundle of stress pressed to make my deadline (April 30), I'm now really excited to (probably) finish everything up today and be able to put the final touches on the presentation before submission. Yes!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>My Latest Creation: wellbean</h3>
          <h4>April 24, 2020</h4>
          <p>Wowza. Whatta Friday. Overall, I made some major progress on learning how to implement Twilio with my app. After a bit of trial and error, I was sooo elated when the programmed messages started coming through to my phone.
            <br><br>
            I'd started with SMS alerts with Twilio, but seeing as that I'm in France and it's just easier to use Whatsapp for me (for testing), I ended up just going with Whatsapp functionality. At the end of the day, the app will still do what I want it to do, regardless of how the message is delivered.
            <br><br>
            And...I suppose now's as good a time as any to announce *what* my actual app is (since I haven't unveiled it yet!).
            <br><br>
            Behold.... WELLBEAN! It's an app that helps users stay connected to loved ones by sending them automated suggestions about who to reach out to on any given day. Just a simple SMS reminder can help plant the seed of connection and cultivate a sense of social well-being.
            <br><br>
            Once it's fully functional, I'm super excited to use it for myself to help me stay in contact with friends and loved ones during this crazy time.
            <br><br>
            Happy weekend, friends! 
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Think Deeply and Forget It</h3>
          <h4>April 23, 2020</h4>
          <p>Ouf. There comes a day in every fun yet challenging yet inspiring week of coding that my brain and body just slam on the brakes. And that day is today.
            <br><br>
          It's Thursday, and I decided to take a break from my hackathon project for the day. Thankfully, it's as fully functional as I need it to be for the time being. Now, I need to hook up the Twilio/SMS send functionality to it.
            <br><br>
          As for today, I'm mostly avoiding high-input items. I'm just about to post this blog (check!) - and then I'll work on crafting today's Nelson newsletter to send out. Lastly, I get to draft up a contract and initial invoice for a new web design client project starting next month.
            <br><br>
          I spent some time reading over the Twilio documentation yesterday, but I have to admit I felt really in over my head. Thankfully I still have a week before the hackathon deadline (April 30), so I can definitely benefit from some much-needed rest. I may need to reach out for help around this - we shall see.
            <br><br>
          As Don Draper says in Mad Men: "Just think about it deeply, then forget it. An idea will jump up in your face."
          <br><br>
          Ya don't have to tell me twice.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Level Unlocked!</h3>
          <h4>April 22, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday, I left off mentioning that I was going to focus on getting each user's account synced up with their own unique settings within my hackathon app. I'm over-the-moon excited and proud to announce that I solved the issue in a relatively short amount of time yesterday (yaaaay).
            <br><br>
          For a little more context, I was writing logic in my program that basically said 'If a user inputs a certain item into their list (Firestore backend), add an ID property to that item that was an exact match with their own user unique ID (uid) (Firebase authentication).'
            <br><br>
          The issue was that whenever I'd log in as one user's email address (a@example.com) and add new items to their account list - I'd log out and then log in again as another test user (b@example.com), and the first user's information and input settings would show up (er, not ideal).
            <br><br>
          After a bit of good ol' fashioned thinking (and a good amount of trial and error), I decided to try to wrap the logic in the Firebase method <code>onAuthStateChanged</code> so that it essentially ran the code again for each new user that logs in. I also had to make sure to remove the list items upon a user logging out so they don't show up for someone else logging in (I'm sure there's a more secure alternative for how to do this, but at this point, I'm trying to focus on getting a *working* model of the app!)
          <br><br>
          Here's a snippet of the code wrapped in the <code>onAuthStateChanged</code> mentioned above:
          </p><br><br> 
<pre>
<code>
auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
   if(user) {
    db.collection('contacts').get()
    .then(snapshot => {
       snapshot.docs.forEach(doc => {
        if(doc.data().id === 
        auth.currentUser.uid) {
          renderContact(doc);
        }
      })
    })
  } 
});                       
</code>
</pre><br>

        <p>Today, I'm focused on rendering the list items in realtime (so as soon as the user enters an input value to be rendered, it won't be necessary to refresh the page to get the info to appear on the UI - it will automatically update. That'll be pretty easy, I know I've watched a tutorial about this - just need to refresh my brain!
          <br><br>
        Also, I'm going to spend some time going over the Twilio documentation to figure out what needs to be done to implement the SMS reminder functionality (I *might* look into Whatsapp messaging instead if it's simpler - we shall see). Onward!
        </p><br><br>

          
          <h3>Programming and the Bigger Picture</h3>
          <h4>April 21, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday, I was an absolute beast with coding and my Twilio hackathon project. Each time I came up against something challenging, I was able to break the issue down into smaller, more manageable parts.
            <br><br>
          It's becoming more and more clear to me how much programming is about knowing what solutions are available and *where* to look for them. The more familiar you are with bigger picture, the more tools you have on hand to put one foot in front of the other to solve hard problems.
            <br><br>
          The deadline for the hackathon is steadily approaching (T-minus 9 days left!), so I realize I need to get going with adding my Twilio API to the app. 
          <br><br>
          But first, I need to focus my attention today on making sure each user is seeing their unique data once they're logged in. I'm confident I'll figure it out, but it was definitely the main issue I ended with yesterday.
            <br><br>
           I'm looking forward to checking back in here tomorrow with a positive report :)
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Go Time</h3>
          <h4>April 20, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Monday! Had a great weekend. Almost (!) no coding, but I admit, I couldn't hold myself back from tinkering with my hackathon project. I added a few more items of functionality, including displaying and hiding certain aspects of the app based on whether or not a user was logged in.
            <br><br>
          Today, I'm going to focus on clearing up some bugs I have with logged in and logged out states. Literally, just this moment of writing gave me a burst of inspiration for fixing something, so I need to wrap this post up and get to it! 
            <br><br>
          Ideally, I'd like to think up a good structure for storing users' data in a Firebase database (I also have the first initial inklings of how to do that from meditating on it this morning - so good).
            <br><br>
          In a perfect world, I'd get my Twilio stuff all set up this week (meaning, starting to add my API logic to the app). In other words, this week is for working hard to get the full MVP out the door and then next week would be QA-ing it and fixing any last minute bugs before submitting it on April 30.
          <br><br>
          Go time :)
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Getting Familiar with Firebase Authorization Fundamentals</h3>
          <h4>April 17, 2020</h4>
          <p>Alright, team. It's a quarter to noon, and I need to get myself into gear for today's work!
            <br><br>
            Had a great morning - reading, writing, and meditating. Looking forward to a productive Friday afternoon.
            <br><br>
            I'd like to get as far as I can with the Firebase Auth tutorial I'm currently following along with. I'd say I'm a little less than halfway there. If I can finish it, that would be amazing; but I'm also not putting way too much pressure on myself in that regard.
            <br><br>
            If I can simply get to a point where I'm comfortable with it, and then move on to implementing user login capabilities with my hackathon project, then that'll be the move.
            <br><br>
            Hoping to release V1 of the UI next week - yeeee!
            <br><br>
            Calling to the muse for inspiration and motivation. Cheers!
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>What It's All About</h3>
          <h4>April 16, 2020</h4>
          <p>Still keepin' on keepin' on with my hackathon project today. Since it's Thursday, I'll also be sending out another <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> newsletter.
            <br><br>
          I'll probably work on getting the newsletter all drafted up first today (to conserve all creative energy and lower the risk of feeling unmotivated to do it later today).
            <br><br>
          Then, I'll continue on with my Firebase authorization tutorial, which I'll probably finish tomorrow. After I learn how to create and store all new users (yay!!!) I'll add that functionality to my hackathon project. To complete it, I'll add the Twilio API as well as logic specific to the app.
            <br><br>
          Woooo! I love love love how this is all coming together. Consistently showing up and making incremental progress, that's what it's all about. Cheers!

          <h3>You Only Do Well What You Know Well</h3>
          <h4>April 15, 2020</h4>
          <p>Spent yesterday following a tutorial for setting up Firebase as a backend database, and I'm *so* loving it! Every time I learn something new with code and web development, it simply blows my mind.
            <br><br>
          I think the most important thing as you're learning to code is the fact that simply being *aware* of what tools you have at your disposal will help you so incredibly much through solving any problems that pop up.
            <br><br>
          My plan for today is to finish up learning the ins and outs of Firebase/Firestore and then learn how to set up user authorization so that I can start implementing sign-up functionality on my app.
            <br><br>
          Oh - I guess I haven't mentioned the overall idea of it. Essentially, the app will be a tool that keeps people connected to their friends and loved ones with automated suggestions about who to contact on a certain day.
          <br><br>
          The user will create an account, create a list of all the individual people they want to be reminded to contact, as well as the frequency of desired reminders (i.e. once a week, twice a month, etc).
          <br><br>
          After I get the database structure organized and set up, I'll start to play around with hooking a Twilio API up to it. At this point, I think the simplest thing to do would be to enable SMS alerts for users.
          <br><br>
          Really, really, really excited about it.
          <br><br>
          And to end this post, here's some inspiration from the label of a really great bottle of wine we recently treated outselves to:</p>
          <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">
              BENE FACIT ID QUOD BENE MAT: You only do well what you know well<br><br>
            </p><br>
          <p>
            Keep learning, keep doing. Fall in love with the process and it'll become a part of who you are.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>So Many Possibilities to Pursue</h3>
          <h4>April 14, 2020</h4>
          <p>I did a lot of CSS grid practice yesterday and it is really just amazing stuff. I'm surprised it took me this long to jump on the bandwagon.
            <br><br>
          But seriously - mobile responsiveness with grid is amazing. I *cannot* wait to continue implementing it into the UIs of the apps I build.
            <br><br>
          I got version one of the project I'm planning on submitting for the DEV x Twilio hackathon. Submissions are due on April 30, so I have about 16 days left to learn how to add a backend to store user data and registrations! Fun stuff, I'm really excited about it.
            <br><br>
          I can't wait to share more about the project, too! I'm keeping it a bit under wraps for now because I want to release it all at once. Considering also starting to record myself with my coding days (using Loom?) and sharing those videos.
          <br><br>
          So, so, so many possibilities to pursue.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Semi-Work Day</h3>
          <h4>April 13, 2020</h4>
          <p>Mondaaaay! Although technically it's a jour ferié in France (the day after Easter), I'm going to treat it as a half-work day for me. Yesterday, I found this amazing YouTube channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Net Ninja</a>, full of great tutorials. 
            <br><br>
            My next move is to learn more about Firebase Firestore for implementing a backend structure to an app I'm planning on building (which I'll learn thanks to this Net Ninja channel!), but then some CSS Grid tutorials caught my eye, and I'm looking forward to using today to brush up on some style skills - especially since I've been wanting to dive into CSS Grid for a while but just haven't gotten around to it.
            <br><br>
            And lastly, as promised...here's the second part of the great tips I gleaned from Thursday's Tech Career AMA:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Know your craft and know how to solve problems. Don’t lean on getting solutions from the internet all the time</li>
            <li>If you show you have the skill to mentor juniors at any point, it’ll go a long way for you in your career</li>
            <li>Once you start a career in tech, try to ramp up on the tech terminology within your industry</li>
            <li>Do all the side projects! Start with a tutorial that’s done something similar to what you want to do and then you can add other things onto it</li>
            <li>There are no full-stack developers who are 100% GREAT at every single part of the stack. Don’t let that hold you back or be intimidating from being a full-stack developer!</li>
            <li>As you’re onboarding a new role, you don’t have to know everything - you’ll be learning constantly</li>
            <li>No matter where you’re coming from, you’re welcome here. If you’re passionate, don’t let anything stop you from pursuing your dream of becoming a developer</li>
            <li>Don’t compare yourself to your peers: everyone is on their own path. For some it could happen more quickly and that’s OK</li>
            <li>As you’re learning, take your time. You don’t need to learn everything in a week because you’ll be learning for the rest of your life!</li>
            </ul>
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>10 Great Break-Into-A-Tech-Career Tips</h3>
          <h4>April 10, 2020</h4>
          <p>It's Fridayyyy! I attended a 'How to advance in your tech career' live AMA (Ask Me Anything) last night, and I'm happy to report I picked up a lot of great nuggets o' wisdom! 
            <br><br>
          So, armed with my trusty Google doc with the video screen taking up the other half of my screen, I got to work taking those notes. 
            <br><br>
          Here are the first ten of some great tips I picked up (I'll post the rest on Monday):</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Be up front about what you want in your career/position even from the interview</li>
              <li>Create content (blog, video, etc) *before* being onboarded for your job; don’t wait until you get hired to start creating content - start now!</li>
              <li>Network - get to know people working for different companies you may be interested in, and even people in general because you don’t know who everyone else knows</li>
              <li>Hiring managers like to see that you’re passionate, you’re putting content out there, you’re showing up every single day</li>
              <li>It’s easy to find developers, it’s not so easy to find that passion in people who do it because they love it and for the joy of it </li>
              <li>As a developer, you'll be paid to solve problems. Whatever enables you to be a strong problem solver with code as your tool -- focus on that -- cultivate that!</li>
              <li>Anyone can learn to make web apps - not everybody has the ability to see the big picture (the architecture, deployment, automation of the deployment, the cloud, etc). Those that can differentiate and explain to others in a visual and accessible way will rise to the top</li>
              <li>You can be the smartest person in the room, but if you can’t work well with others - that can really slow things down</li>
              <li>Being able to present, communicate ideas clearly and succinctly will help you in general throughout your entire career</li>
              <li>Life at times ask you to show up and go for iit… or pass. Don’t pass! </li>
            </ul>
          <br><br> 
          <h3>Spring Afternoons and Completed To-Do's</h3>
          <h4>April 9, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Thursday afternoon! We just finished up a wonderful lunch out on our balcony. Sunny, breezy, peaceful - everything good about a spring afternoon. I'm grateful.
            <br><br>
          Yesterday, I finally buckled up and crossed off two of this week's items from the list. First, I added the 'Previous Editions' section to my <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> landing page. 
          <br><br>
          This'll give prospective subscribers a chance to see what the newsletter has to offer - always a good thing when considering signing up for any newsletter, I think.
            <br><br>
          The second thing I did was to add the entire Letters from Nelson project to my portfolio itself (hint: just click on the Projects tab above to check that out). 
            <br><br>
          On days when you're just not feelin' it, *the* most important thing you can do is to make the decision to show up.
          <br><br>
          If you're wanting to go for a run, make the decision and then squeeze yourself into your sports bra.
          <br><br>
          If you're wanting to code something, make the decision and then open your text editor and code one thing. 
          <br><br>
          If you're wanting to blog everyday, make the decision and then sit down day after day and write literally whatever's on your mind.
          <br><br>
          The last couple of days, I was so putting off my to-do list items, and then I just *made the decision* to show up, sat down and got to work. A couple of focused hours later and voilà! Mission(s) accomplished!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>When JavaScript Becomes a Part of You</h3>
          <h4>April 8, 2020</h4>
          <p>When I was *first* learning to code over a year ago with HTML and CSS and wondering what I'd move on to next - I remember talking on Slack with one of my colleagues - an engineer. This coworker was really such a helpful source during those first few months with his encouragement and perspective.
            <br><br>
          One really helpful thing he said to me definitely made an effect - so much so that I immediately wrote it down at the time for fear of not remembering it one day (and I'm so glad I did!):</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">
              JavaScript is going to be a new journey - since it’s a full-blown programming language. However, the fun is also on a whole new level - it’ll make you feel like a wizard! <br><br>
              
              Don’t look at it all at once. Start one step at a time - you won’t even notice how it’ll become a part of you.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>That final 'you won't even notice how it'll become a part of you' is so incredibly accurate. With every passing day of learning and sharpening the skills we have, programming becomes a part of us.
            <br><br>
            It becomes a part of us in the way we think. In the way we solve problems. In the way we accept that we don't know the answer right now but give us some time and we have the confidence to figure it out.
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Stoking the Motivation</h3>
          <h4>April 7, 2020</h4>
          <p>We're in the midst of Week 3 of lockdown in France, and I have to admit, I keep getting a later and later start with sitting down to my work. This may be a more sit-and-relax-and-don't-stress-too-much-about-output time - so I'll follow suit.
            <br><br>
            Despite that, I still *do* want to somewhat make progress with my coding journey.
            <br><br>
            Today's post will be my three things I'm focusing on today/this week. My to-do list from yesterday was rather ambitious and I found that about 75% of it was pushed to today, so it's definitely going to be one of *those* weeks lol.
            <br><br>
            Here goes! Goals for this week:
            <br><br>
            
            1. Finish Section 8 of my JS course (has to do with AJAX and APIs and I'm actually almost completely finished so that's A-OK)
              <br>
              <br>
            2. Scope out hackathon project - this fits in perfectly with what I'm currently learning with APIs (see above), so I'm excited to get a project idea I have out of my head and out the door!<br><br>
            3. Add past editions of the <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> newsletter to the site *and* add LFN to my portfolio list
            <br><br>
            (And sprinkle in lots of reading and break-taking, as well!)            
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Rinse, Repeat, Refactor</h3>
          <h4>April 6, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Monday! Yesterday, I sort of broke my 'no work on the weekends' rule and worked a bit on my JS course. Mostly just went over a coding challenge a couple of times to really cement in the information. It was great and I got a lot more practice with writing good, effective code.
            <br><br>
          One thing I do when I'm repeating a challenge or a project more than once is to make sure I really stop and think about the solution to something - especially when I'm stuck, but I know I've found a similar answer before.
            <br><br>
          It's extremely helpful to get yourself a working solution *before* checking the solution so that you can put the puzzle pieces in your head before glancing at something that will immediately remind you of the correct answer without the work of those neurons firing in your brain to retain the learning.
            <br><br>
          I'll put in a little example here. For the coding challenge, we had to generate a couple of reports about the three parks and four streets in a tiny town using classes and functions to display the reports to the console. 
          <br><br>
          For one part of the challenge, we needed to log a statement to the console if any of the parks had over 1000 trees (the number of trees was included as a parameter in the Park class as numTrees). Here was my first attempt in thinking it through by myself:
          <br><br></p>
<pre>
  <code>
  const checkNumTrees = () => {
    for (const element of parks) {
      if (element.numTrees > 1000) {
        console.log(`${element.name} has more than 
        1000 trees with ${element.numTrees} 
        trees in total.`);
      }
    }
  };              
  </code>
</pre><br>

          <p>So, the above function gets the job done, albeit not very beautifully. Going through it the next time, here's how it could be simplified:</p>
          <br><br>
<pre>
  <code>
  parks.forEach(element => {
    if (element.numTrees > 1000) {
      console.log(`${element.name} has more than 
      1000 trees with ${element.numTrees} 
      trees in total.`);
    }
  });                      
  </code>
</pre><br>
        <p>So now it's been simplified by using the calling the forEach method on the parks array while still using the if statement within the function. Better, but here's where it could be improved even further:</p>
          <br><br>
<pre>
  <code>
  const index = p.map(el => el.numTrees).findIndex(
    el => el >= 1000);
  console.log(`${p[index].name} has over 1000 
  trees with a total of ${p[index].numTrees} trees.`);                   
  </code>
</pre><br>
        <p>I'd say that overall, this last refactor gets the job done very cleverly, but for me, the clearest way of writing it would be the second way. I see it, and I immediately know what the function does and what results it should return; whereas, with this last refactor, it would definitely take me a minute to figure it all out.
        <br><br> 
        I wonder if that'll change as I get more and more experience (probably). Although I've often heard that it's better to write clear, easy code than it is to write overly clever code. </p>
        
          <br><br> 
          <h3>Inspiration and Playing the Infinite Game</h3>
          <h4>April 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>Hi friends! Wow, it's crazy how inspiration can leave for a bit to take a break and then come back tenfold after you just give it a little bit of rest!
            <br><br>
          Here's where I'm at: I've finally launched my own landing page for my <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> newsletter (I'd just thrown it up before using the landing page builder from Mailchimp with the intention of coding my own in the near future).
            <br><br>
          So after a couple of days and a few false-starts with design (you know - where you code something up, and there's just something about it that looks super *off*), I'm proud to share it <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here >></a>
            <br><br>
          Over the past month, I've sent out four newsletters. I did a ton of nannying in previous years, and I *loved* finding super fun and unique activities for the kids I took care of - so this is definitely an extension of that in hopes of helping parents out with fun ideas for their kids during this strange time in our world.
          <br><br>
          Aside from that, I have a couple of 'life admin' items to take care of today - including hooking up a custom domain to my LFN site. I might have a weekend project of reconstructing the code from a website I saw and liked the design of. Also looking into a cool hackathon and seeing how I can get involved!
          <br><br>
          I also just started a new morning read - The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek. I'll leave you with this special nugget from the book: </p>
          <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">
              As for us, those who choose to embrace an infinite mindset, our journey is one that will lead us to feel inspired every morning, safe when we are at work and fulfilled at the end of each day. And when it is our time to leave the game, we will look back at our lives and our careers and say 'I lived a life worth living.' And more important, when imagining what the future holds, we will see how many people we've inspired to carry on the journey without us.
            </p>
            <br><br> 
          <h3>Starting Off Slowly in April</h3>
          <h4>April 1, 2020</h4>
          <p>Hello! It's about 20 minutes after 6pm and this may be my latest-in-the-day blog post yet, but I'm happy to have shown up!
            <br><br>
            Today's been a much slower day, and it's really felt good! Last night, I'm proud to have sent off my finished application to give a talk at this year's virtual CodeLand Conference! I've never submitted a proposal for a conference CFP, and I can gladly say that I've crossed that one off my coding-journey bucketlist.
            <br><br>
            Regardless of the outcome, I'm happy to have put my foot forward, and I'm confident I'll give a talk about coding at some point in the next few months, whatever that may look like!
            <br><br>
            I think I'm going to continue taking it easy for the rest of the day and tie up any current loose ends with my projects going on right now. I haven't worked too much lately on my Letters from Nelson app, so I might settle in to that and then push out a working app to start sending visitors to (instead of the thrown-together landing page à la Mailchimp!)
            <br><br>
            Here's to the start of April and two months already of consistent blogging - yee!
          </p>
          <br><br> 
          <h3>Off to a Late Start</h3>
          <h4>March 31, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Tuesday! I've almost completely finished up my latest section of my JavaScript course, where we go over the updates of ES6 from ES5 with concepts like classes/subclasses, destructuring, the spread operator, rest and default parameters.
            <br><br>
          All such good stuff! I'm really excited to build another app with the course - the next one will be a recipe app, I think we may be incorporating APIs in this one, not sure though.
            <br><br>
          I'm getting a rather late start today since feeling a little under the weather this morning. Long story short, I watched The Pursuit of Happyness last night, and emotional hangovers are most *definitely* a thing.
            <br><br>
          I'm looking to put much of my focus today on submitting my application for my CodeLand talk and also finishing up my JS section by working on a coding challenge involving classes and subclasses. Let's get to it!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>The Start of a Great Week</h3>
          <h4>March 30, 2020</h4>
          <p>Goooood morning! Happy to be back at it again this week after a restful and long-feeling weekend without coding.
            <br><br>
            Today my focus is on finishing up a section of my JavaScript course where we're diving into coding some of the same things using first ES5 and then ES6 right after to review the differences between the two. It's cool because I first learned ES6 when I was just starting out with JavaScript last year, and reviewing it now feels good and easy - especially now that I'm so much more familiar with the 'why' of how much of JS works.
            <br><br>
            In other news, I'm going to be submitting my first application for a coding conference talk! It'll be with CodeLand (virtual this year in light of COVID-19). I have until tomorrow to submit it and I'm going to be working on the questions portion of the application today.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, I've been wanting to find and join an open source project for a while now, but I've literally had no idea how to. I'd always get confused on GitHub's calls for open source issues and 'Good for First Timers' options as well, and I had a feeling that I'd be better of finding *one* project and sticking to that one for a while.
            <br><br>
            Well... I think I found the perfect one (more details to come, but it involves an online library - so books plus coding equals my kind of heaven).
            <br><br>
            In a nutshell, I reached out to the team via email after stumbling open the project from a Facebook post. I then got a quick and enthusiastic response the next morning (I'm all about those fast turn-arounds!), got invited to their Slack group, and reviewed a quick list of some example issues that needed working on. I'll focus today on getting myself set up within the channel and getting a feel for the project, etc.
            <br><br>
            It looks like it's going to be a great week! 
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Daily Life as a Practice</h3>
          <h4>March 27, 2020</h4>
          <p>And Friday rolls around, yet again! The days of the week now tend to blend together, so it feels like the weekend is just another set of days tacked on to the long stretch of confinement, but alas we all float on.
            <br><br>
          Today my main focus will be on starting the next section of my JavaScript course - something that's been on my to-do list probably every day this week but has yet to be actually implemented. No time like the present!
          <br><br>
          Anyway, I came upon this little nugget in my morning reading (surprise! It's once again from Steven Pressfield's Turning Pro):
          </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">
              Our work is a practice. One bad day is nothing to us. Ten bad days are nothing.
            </p>
            <br><br>
          <p>
            This is so true for so many things in my life currently. In times like these, it feels simple and almost effortless for me to get all the way back to basics. To stick to my morning routine. To carry on with my daily habits. To view it all as playing the long game. 
            <br><br>
            I've noticed a lot of people in my life are finding it difficult to adapt to staying and working from home (with less freedom of going out, etc). For me, it's the best time to get back to those basics and to take advantage of the time to start building and further cultivating good habits - whether that be with exercising, meditating, writing, getting a good night's sleep, or anything else.
            <br><br>
            If we start viewing our daily habits as individual practices that we show up for as often as we promise ourselves we will, we won't fall victim to obstacles or setbacks. We'll just pick back up tomorrow and carry on with our amazing lives.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>The Power of Getting Shit Done</h3>
          <h4>March 26, 2020</h4>
          <p>After my not-so-productive Tuesday of this week, yesterday (Wednesday) was definitely a come-back.
            <br><br>
          As always, the most difficult part of getting all your stuff done is 1) actually starting and 2) actually *focusing* on each individual task.
            <br><br>
          So often, we run around stressed out about what there is to do, talking anyone's ear off about how stressed and busy we are, and then only half-assing each item on our list. At the end of the day, guess what! Nothing has really gotten done.
            <br><br>
          Anyway - as much as I could go on and on about that, let's get started on today. I've just finished this morning's YouTube exercise video (I've been getting really consistent with those so, yesssss!) and then today I'm going to be working on my <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> app and sending out a newsletter to the email list.
            <br><br>
          Yesterday, I also spent a very focused hour building a spreadsheet for ideas for the newsletter, so that has removed a lot of the 'unknown' in terms of what to send out and when. Plus! More and more ideas have been coming to me, and I'm so thankful to have a designated place for all those little nuggets of inspiration.
            <br><br>
          Here's to another productive day and making little bouts of progress, however they may look for you. 
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Working through a Conscious Lull</h3>
          <h4>March 25, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday was one of those days where I just accepted that nothing was going to really get done. A bit of a weekday break of anything coding/technical-related.
            <br><br>
          Things on my mind today: 
          <br><br>
          1) Working more on my Letters from Nelson idea-generating app - specifically the design and classList toggling I want to do on certain clicks. 
          <br><br>
          I also had the idea of implementing the 'Add an idea' feature as a pop-up box that displays in an absolute position with the textarea and submit button there. I'll play around with that idea a bit.
            <br><br>
          2) Getting the next six weeks of Letters from Nelson newsletter planned out on a spreadsheet. I've been having such resistance with this, so I might as well get things done now so it's not all left up to reactivity and getting things out the door at the last minute.
            <br><br>
          This week (not necessarily today), I'd also like to move on to the next section of my JS course (after multiple run-throughs of the budget app section). 
          <br><br>
          Progress - woooo!
          </p><br><br> 
       <h3>Little Pleasures and Consistent Progress</h3>
          <h4>March 23, 2020</h4>
          <p>Back for another Monday - one of the best days! I spent a relaxing weekend with Arthur and Nelson, just doing things around the apartment, cooking nice meals, building a puzzle, and even taking a long walk around our neighborhood (with permission slips in hand, of course). It's amazing how much we're appreciating the small (tiny!) beautiful things in our lives during these strange times.
            <br><br>
          My objective this week is to ease up from my budget application and continue on to the next steps of my JavaScript practice. As to what that looks like - I'll probably run through how to update the percentages of each item within the budget app one more time before brushing my hands off and wrapping it up.
            <br><br>
          I'll definitely come back to it in the future, especially for coding up a budget app of my own (i.e. not using any previously-coded samples or html files from the tutorial itself). That way, I'll be able to add it to my portfolio.
            <br><br>
          In terms of other ideas, I was inspired by something I saw yesterday - and now I want to code up an idea generator for parents to do with kids at home - much in the same vein as my Letters from Nelson project. Last night, I sat down with my notebook and brainstormed which modules and functions would be necessary for that.
            <br><br>
          I was amazed at how much progress I'd made up until this point simply by being able to fully visualize the application itself and which components needed to do what, etc. Excited to get to work on that and share it with the world!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>A Different but Overall Great Week</h3>
          <h4>March 20, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Friday! This week has been different, but overall, I'm grateful there hasn't been a staggering level of change from my normal routine working from home. 
            <br><br>
          Yesterday, I scrapped my latest app.js file for my budget app and started anew! Round 4 (I think?) of building out the app on my own. This time, I've still left the functions and methods up as a sort of program 'skeleton' to remind me of what to add where. Even in doing so, I am *so* proud of myself for filling in the majority of functions with *no* notes!
            <br><br>
          The plan for today is to finish up Round 4 of building out the app (it's amazing how much quicker I can do it now than at the beginning of last week). Then, for next week - my focus will be on Round 5 of rebuilding it from absolute scratch. Wowza.
            <br><br>
          I'll also be laying out the scope of the next six weeks for the <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> newsletter. I'm so looking forward to digging through ideas for future editions.
          <br><br>
          It's been a great week. Here's to focusing on the things we can control and taking care of ourselves in the meantime.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Onward and Upward</h3>
          <h4>March 19, 2020</h4>
          <p>Whew! Adjusting to a two-person work-from-home experience has been exactly that... an adjustment.
            <br><br>
            Nothing negative, by any means whatsoever. But it is quite interesting to notice the small ways my daily routine has been changing. Regardless, I'm still doing my best to get in my read-journal-meditate morning routine and couple good hours of solid coding and learning.
            <br><br>
            I'm also pleasantly surprised at myself for taking to YouTube workouts in stride. I suppose that's to be expected when you have no other choice? (In France, we're currently on lockdown, so no gym or runs outside for me).
            <br><br>
            I took a small break from coding yesterday as I was busy launching an email newsletter geared at helping parents whose kids are stuck at home due to the virus. It's going to be such a good time curating all the ideas for kids to see and do, virtually. You can view the project and subscribe here if you're so inclined: <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/letters-from-nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Nelson</a> 
            <br><br>
            As for today, I'm set on reviewing what I've been working on this week and possibly re-coding the addItem, deleteItem, and updatePercentages portions of my budget app. Onward and upward!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Consistent Steps Lead to Mastery</h3>
          <h4>March 17, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday, the main focus of my coding work was in really working to understand how the addItem and deleteItem functionalities worked within my budget app.
            <br><br>
          To get a 100% clear picture, I sat down and took out a notebook and a pencil. I started with the deleteItem functionality, since that's what I'd left off on last week. From there, I looked at each of my three modules: the budget controller (data structure/behind the scenes of the app), the UI controller (what's viewable or able to be interacted with on the app's user interface), and the app controller (the part of the code responsible for enabling the budget controller and the UI controller to interact with and get information from one another).
            <br><br>
          I studied each piece and *consciously made sense of it in my mind* before moving on to the next function. I then did the same thing with the addItem functionality.
            <br><br>
          What I found was so interesting was that when I really took the time to isolate each specific functionality of the app and map everything out from beginning to end, it gave me such an incredibly clear idea of how everything fits together in the bigger picture of the entire app.
            <br><br>
          Today, my focus is on doing the same thing as yesterday as I map out the functionality of calculating the percentages of each expense against the total Income. 
          <br><br>
          The process of consciously and consistently working toward understanding how a program works has been fascinating, to say the least. I'm confident that having a solid routine in place - even if it allows you to put in the work only one hour a day - is *the* key to finding success as a self-taught programmer.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Just Keep Coding</h3>
          <h4>March 16, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Monday! Over the weekend, the social life of France has essentially been placed on lockdown, but we're well-prepared. I'm especially excited to get some major coding done over the next few weeks. 
            <br><br>
          I just did an unexpectedly cool (and surprisingly easy!) thing this morning in removing all of the '.html' extensions from my page URLs. Essentially, it has to do with adding a .htaccess file to your root directory and then creating a couple of rules and pushing it to your server (pushing it to GitHub, where my portfolio site is hosted, for me).
            <br><br>
          Back to Monday. I ended last week on my third build of my budget app. At this point, it's becoming clearer and clearer where exactly I need to focus my learning energy. YAY for clarity because, let me tell ya, I didn't know which direction I was quite going last week during my solo build of the app. As one of my mentors, Marie Forleo, says: Clarity comes from action, not thought.
            <br><br>
          My three things I'm focused on today:
          <br><br>
          1. Picking back up on my budget app and focusing on the 'Delete Item from list' functionality specifically.
          <br><br>
          2. Writing out my list of steps to take and what to focus on when building and rebuilding an app (from tutorial to full mastery of it)
          <br><br>
          3. Checking out an online course called Full Stack Open and seeing if it's something I should add to my learning strategy at this time or not.
          <br><br>
          Happy Monday, again - this week is fully underway!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>In Progress: Breaking Away from the Tutorials</h3>
          <h4>March 13, 2020</h4>
          <p>Happy Friday! This has been an exceptionally great week for me in terms of personal motivation.
            <br><br>
            I'm proud to say that I've completed my morning routine each morning (reading, journaling, and ten minutes of
            meditation before diving into any work stuff), I've made great progress on my budget app (Round 2: redoing the
            tutorial *and* Round 3: building the app but not following the tutorial videos), and I've been being more mindful of
            my health (staying hydrated, eating balanced meals, exercising regularly, getting lots of sleep, etc).
            <br><br>
            In terms of the budget app, I started in on Round 3 (building the app but not following the tutorial videos)
            yesterday, and it was actually quite a challenge! Definitely a great example of why it's important to follow along
            with tutorials up until a certain point but then to consciously break away from them in order to build an app on your
            own.
            <br><br>
            To put it simply, it's hard! And it's definitely not as sexy as coding up a storm by following along with a tutorial. <br><br> But it's so, so
            important - and I'd go so far as to say it's *the* factor that sets self-taught developers apart from one another along their
            learning journeys: those who make the conscious decision to solve problems on their own and those who stay in the shallow end with the comfort and relative safety of tutorials.
            <br><br>
            But the magic there lies in pushing through those obstacles. In consistently overcoming that often-disheartening feeling of starting from 0. In keeping true to the vision, even and especially through
            the tough and uncertain parts.
            <br><br>
            I haven't gotten there in this specific context, but past experience tells me I'll *love* what I see when I come
            out on the other side.
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>How to Dynamically Set the Date Using JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>March 12, 2020</h4>
          <p>Update: I finished Round 2 of my budget app yesterday! After doing so, I took out all of the functionality from the app (but left the function/method and variable names) so that I can go through and fill everything out myself. <br><br> 
            It's easy to feel like I'm not really doing any groundbreaking learning, but I really do think this repetition in an increasingly challenging way is helping me *so* much.
            <br><br>
          Anyway, I learned this nifty trick to dynamically render the date on a web page using the Date object in JavaScript. Here's how that would look using a function: </p>
            <br>
<pre>
  <code>
  var displayMonth = function() {

   var now, year, month, months;

   now = new Date();

   year = now.getFullYear();
      
   months = ['January', 'February', 'March',
   'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August',
   'September', 'October', 'November', 
   'December'];

   month = now.getMonth();

   document.querySelector(***).textContent = 
   months[month] + ' ' + year;
  };
    </code>
 </pre><br>
          <p>So, if this code were running today, it would show 'March 2020' on the page, and then next month, it would dynamically render 'April 2020.' <br><br>
          The <code>now</code> variable pulls up a new instance of the Date object with today's date. The <code>year</code> variable uses that instance to get the current year with the getFullYear method of the Date object. <br><br>
          I create the <code>months</code> array with the 12 months of the year, and then we can use the getMonth method on the <code>now</code> variable to return a number 0-11 depending on which month it is. For this example, it returns 2 for March (since arrays start from 0). <br><br>
          Lastly, I update the text content of whatever class I query (this would just be a wrapper in the HTML file around where I wanted the date to go on the site) to the <code>months</code> array at the specific month index (in this case, 2 for March), a space, and the corresponding <code>year</code> variable. Voilà! </p><br><br>
          <h3>Hump Day Plans</h3>
          <h4>March 11, 2020</h4>
          <p>Not too much on my mind this morning. (I always think that and then sit down to write the morning blog post and then write a lot more than anyone bargained for lol.)
            <br><br>
          On today's agenda: Finish round 2 of my budget app. It should take me a couple of focused hours. Googling 'timer one hour' and hitting enter usually helps tons with keeping the focus. 10/10, would recommend for anyone struggling with working efficiently for chunks of time (i.e. not scrolling through social media or finding another distraction every couple of minutes).
            <br><br>
          I'm also going to get my plan of action down on paper today re: re-developing one of my websites, <a href="http://www.soyouthinkyoucanfrance.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So You Think You Can France</a>, so that I can host it myself instead of on Squarespace. It should be a major project, so I'd like to finish my JS course before really digging in because I'm actively trying not to put myself in a position where I'm pulled in too many directions at once.
            <br><br>
          Cheers!
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>Finish the Project, Then Code It Again (and Again)</h3>
          <h4>March 10, 2020</h4>
          <p>I'm pleased to announce that the second run-through of my budget app is swimming along so much faster than the first! The combination of already knowing the overall structure and the familiarity with the code that has already been written has proven quite handy in really sealing in the lesson.
            <br><br>
          The only annoying thing is that I'm still very conscious of the fact that - if left to my own devices - I still wouldn't be able to code this all on my own. So, I think once I've finished coding the budget app this time around, I'll simply list out the steps and then code it all up without going along with the lessons themselves. 
            <br><br>
          Granted, it'll be largely from a place of memorization, I think it'll definitely help fill in the gaps in my knowledge by pointing out exactly where I'm getting stuck. Then, I'll be able to double down on those bits and improve from there.
          </p><br><br> 
          <h3>A New Way of Reading for Self-Improvement</h3>
          <h4>March 9, 2020</h4>
          <p>While the weeks slowly pass by, Mondays often seem to roll around quite quickly for me - which I'm not complaining about, since it's the day I get to dive back into coding and projects!
            <br><br>
          Not too much to say this morning, but I did see an interesting Twitter post where someone claimed that instead of reading one business/self-improvement book at a time, he actually reads several. So, on average a chapter of each per day.
            <br><br>
          At first, I was like, Whaaaaat? That seems so strange. So of course, I tried it out. On the drive back home last night, I had one eye on my Kindle and the other on the road... Just kidding, I wasn't driving! But, I decided to give it a try with three books that I've already read and loved:
            <br><br>
            - Turning Pro by Steven Pressfield <br>
            - You are a Badass by Jen Sincero <br>
            - It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work by Basecamp's Jason Fried and DHH <br><br>
            And I continued on with it for this morning's reading! It's a little strange, but it's actually kind of cool - it's like being in a room with these incredibly smart people and getting a few daily lessons from each. To be continued? We'll see!
            <br><br>
          As for what's on my plate for this week, I'm going to be taking apart my budget app and putting it all back together again. I'm also going to be looking into taking a website I've crafted off of Squarespace and re-developing it myself so as to be able to add it to my developer portfolio - an idea that struck me out of nowhere last night as we barrelled through the French countryside under a full moon - also to be continued... 
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Round 1: Complete</h3>
          <h4>March 6, 2020</h4>
          <p>This week, I accomplished my goal of finishing up my budget app tutorial with the JavaScript course I'm currently taking. In a final step for me, I took a huge piece of paper and copied out the overall structure and functions of the app. Now...is it totally finished/complete and does it finally give me the opportunity to move on to the next project right away?!
            <br><br>
          Certainly not!
            <br><br>
          In fact, I'm going to be taking it apart first thing next week (dare I say... deleting all the code?!) and redoing it from a place of more familiarity with the overall structure and functionality of the entire app and how its components all fit together. I'm feeling excited about it, but also sad that I have to delete all ~450 lines of the app's code. Maybe I should print it out for nostalgia's sake...
            <br><br>
          Anywho, we're off to the French countryside for an impromptu weekend en famille. Since I won't be coding, I'm looking forward to hitting the ground running come Monday. Ciao!
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>The Weird Thing About Deleting Items from Lists in JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>March 5, 2020</h4>
          <p>When we create any type of program that includes functionality for adding and deleting items from a list on an app's interface, we need to pay extra attention to the features we include to delete items.
            <br><br>
          Before learning how to delete items off of lists, in my mind it seemed as simple as telling that specific item to delete itself from the DOM and it would disappear. But this is so wrong, and it really doesn't make any sense if you really think about it and have some JS experience under your belt.
            <br><br>
          Essentially, we can't just tell an item to delete itself. Instead, the deletion needs to be the responsibility of another related item. So, what we actually need is the item's parent element to do the deleting. Once we have access to that parent element, we can use the removeChild property to do so.
            <br><br>
          In other words, it's impossible to delete the item itself in JS, so we need to move up from the element to the parent node and then insert that same element to be removed into the removeChild property. Here's an example of that as a method of an object: </p> <br>
<pre>
  <code>
deleteListItem: function(selectorID) {
  document.getElementById
  (selectorID.parentNode
  .removeChild(document.
  getElementByID(selectorID));
}
    </code>
</pre><br>
    <p>And here's that same example after a bit of cleaning up/prettifying:</p><br>
<pre>
  <code>
deleteListItem: function(selectorID) {

   var element = 
   document.getElementById(selectorID);

  element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
 }
  </code>
</pre><br>
        <p>
          The end.
        </p><br><br>
          <h3>Getting Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable</h3>
          <h4>March 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>Something I continually think about is the idea/necessity of being comfortable with temporary discomfort when it comes to growth or leveling up in life. We can apply this simple yet effective concept to absolutely anything we come up against, and - instead of giving up just as the going gets tough - we can positively thrive over time and after getting more habituated to the discomfort.
            <br><br>
          I was in my Body Pump class at the gym yesterday that I try to get to twice a week. It kicks my butt - and it's certainly never comfortable in the moment - but I also find such motivation to push my body each time to get stronger. The routine stays the same for a few months, so it's easy to start getting used to what to expect each class, but it's also a great way to track your progress in terms of taking fewer breaks during the repititions or adding more weight to your bar.
            <br><br>
          Pushing through the hard parts when it's really freaking grueling is the ultimate sweet spot where you're pushing yourself to the next level.
            <br><br>
          And it's the same for me with coding. Day after day, I know that if I continue to show up and put in the work (which, let's face it, isn't comfortable the majority of the time), I'll get better and grow to be an all-around better developer.
            <br><br>
          Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is probably one of the best things we can do for ourselves under any circumstances when our goal is grow, improve, and ultimately master whatever we want to.

        <h3>JavaScript Budget App Updates</h3>
          <h4>March 3, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday I made some major headway on my budget app (following along with building it via my JS course) in that I got all of the primary functionality working (i.e. entering incomes and expenses, making the calculations behind the scenes and also on the UI, etc).
            <br><br>
          What I'm now focusing on is the functionality behind deleting individual items from the list once they've been added as an income or expense. I've more or less done this before, but it's so great to go through it all in a very clear and well-explained manner - rather than relying on a few patched-together blog posts from various internet sources.
            <br><br>
          As mentioned before, my goal for this week is to get the app up and running and then to take it apart and rebuild it. I'll probably go through the course instructions again but this time with the foresight of knowing what comes next and all that good stuff. I'll probably also write out general notes for myself to help me when I eventually build it on my own without following along with the course. Reminder to self: learning is not linear.
            <br><br>
          I'm also currently building the app with three different modules as IIFEs (immediately invoked function expressions), but I'm looking forward to updating those as separate modules. The three modules are the budget controller (behind the scenes for the income and expense databases), the UI controller (responsible for any changes to the UI based on user interactions), and the app/global controller (responsible for connecting the budget controller and the UI controller, and for initializing the app).
          <br><br>
          I'm also getting a major lesson on code architecture and keeping everything organized. I'm learning about the importance of thinking about and writing out the structure of the program well before typing the first line of code. All really great stuff!
          </p><br><br> 

      <h3>Diving into March (and Coding)</h3>
      <h4>March 2, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Happy Monday and happy March! Starting off Month #3 of 2020 already - crazy, but in a good way! I personally feel great about it because in other times, each new month was accompanied by feelings of 'How the heck is it already March?!' and 'Time is passing me by and I don't even know where it's going!!'
        <br><br>
        From my previous post - I admittedly didn't get much coding done on Friday. I mentioned I try not to code on the weekends, but even on Friday it was tough for me to get in the zone - so I kind of didn't lol. I think I may have cracked open the text editor for an hour at best, added a new feature to the budget app I'm building along with my JS course, and called it a day.
        <br><br>
        But all in all, we're doin' quite alright, folks! Today I'm pretty tired, but I'm angling to get back into the coding mix. This week, my goal is to finish the budget app tutorial, and also to get really comfortable with it's structure and how the different modules of code fit together (still kind of mind-boggling, but I can feel those neurons firing upstairs!).
        <br><br>
        That way, next week, I can take it all apart and build it back up again! <br><br>

        So, as I prepare myself to dive back into all the code, here's a great quote I picked up from From Steven Pressfield's The War of Art this morning:
      </p><br><br>
      <p class="excerpt">
        There's no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our minds to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        In the interest of turning pro, I'm now heading into battle - despite the start-of-the-week drowsiness. Wish me luck! 
      </p>
      <br><br>
          <h3>Monday is the New Friday</h3>
          <h4>February 28, 2020</h4>
          <p>
          Something I've noticed over the past few weeks that I didn't realize before is the finite mental capacity we have each week. If we're going all-out day after day, it's recipe for burnout, loss of motivation, boredom - you know, all the fun stuff we simply assume is a just a necessary part of the work (hot take: it's not).
            <br><br>
          My week looks a little something like this: Monday through Friday, I spend anywhere from one to a few hours coding, learning - whatever it looks like to push me in the direction of where I want to be in the future. During those days, I give myself until around 6pm to do it, and if I don't - well, I just don't get my work done for that day (which I don't like, and which doesn't happen often, mind you).
            <br><br>
          After 6pm on weekdays, I dedicate my time to purely non-work activities - reading, spending time with my friends and loved ones, being outside, building a puzzle, watching Mad Men.
            <br><br>
          And then weekends, I don't code. I don't work. I don't stress out about sending in job applications or getting back to every email. Or at least I try my hardest not to. 
          <br><br>
          Weekends are sacred and restful. And this is a huge transition from how I treated off-time in the past. Before, I was going nonstop, pushing myself well past any limits that may have been there. Now, I have a healthy separation between work time and rest/play/decompress time.
          <br><br>
          Restful weekends and evenings allow for us to recharge and get excited about the work we get to dig in to the next day or week. When Friday rolls around, I can really feel the difference in my energy level compared to Monday when I was fresh and ready to roll. 
          <br><br>
          I love Fridays, but - dare I say - I think I may now love Mondays more.
          </p><br><br>
      <h3>The Unexpected Blessing of Being Out of Work</h3>
          <h4>February 27, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday I was inspired by someone on Twitter proclaiming the improvements to her overall life despite being out of work and on the hunt for a new job. And I fully, completely agree.
            <br><br>
          Fortunately, in my final months at my last job (which I left at the end of 2019), I was able to really put my head down and save up a hefty living expense fund that's set to last me several months. I knew I wanted to make the transition to become a software developer, and I also knew that I didn't want to be rushed and at the end of my rope financially when it came to finding the perfect fit for my career.
            <br><br>
          In the two months that I've been unemployed, I've done so, so much. Not to mention, I'm probably in the best place I've been physically, mentally, and emotionally - maybe ever.
            <br><br>
          Giving myself the opportunity for a long runway definitely took some planning and sacrifice in the months leading up to it, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I currently spend my days working through my JavaScript learning process, building projects, applying to jobs only (!!) if they inspire me and make me feel like I'd like to be a part of the team, going to the park with my pup, reading (so much reading), getting regular wonderful exercise, and getting at least 8-9 hours of sleep every night.
          <br><br>
          As I was leafing through my copy of How To Be Parisian Wherever You Are (love this sassy little book!), this passage stood out to me, especially during this particular period of my life:</p><br><br>
          <p class="excerpt">Take the time to talk to the elderly lady next door, to read a book, to walk to work instead of riding the subway when it's a beautiful day. Take the time to escape for a weekend with friends. <br><br>
          Take the time to listen and to get to know yourself. Take the time to change, to grow, to rest. Take the time to say yes, take the time to say no. Take the time to look after your body, to eat well. Take the time to ask yourself who you are and what you want. <br><br>
          ... <br><br>
          Take the time to take time because nobody else will do it for you.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>So, in this beautiful, lingering period of being between jobs and in the midst of a major career transition, here's to doing just that.</p>
          <br><br> 
      <h3>'You Must Continue To...'</h3>
          <h4>February 26, 2020</h4>
          <p>Last weekend, I was set on attending a conference detailing the life of iconic artist, Frida Kahlo. I'd seen the announcement online and swiftly cancelled my normal Saturday morning Body Pump class at my gym in favor of a more cultural pursuit.
            <br><br>
          Lo and behold, after around an hour in line (it was suggested to arrive early due to limited seating), and just as I'd gained entrance into the building, we were told that capacity had been reached. Grrr!
            <br><br>
          Instead of regarding the morning as a failure, I had a backup plan, which included grabbing a latte from one of my favorite cafes, taking a seat on a sun-drenched bench on the bank of the river, and leafing through the copy of Crime and Punishment I'd brought with me (just in case, you know, there was a need for another plan).
            <br><br>
          When I got back home, I decided to watch a couple of short features about Kahlo's life anyway, and this quote from husband Diego Rivera to Kahlo after first viewing some of her early work struck a deep chord of inspiration:
          </p><br><br> 
          <p class="excerpt">In my opinion, no matter how difficult it may be for you,<br> you must continue to paint.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>I took this as a nudge for me to continue to code each and every day. Even (and especially) when it's difficult to feel the progress or when it seems like a certain concept has the least likely chance of clicking. 
          <br><br>
          Whatever it is you're trying to learn or build, stay the course. You must continue to do it - every single day. You'll be glad you did when you look back in the future and thank your past self for your tenacious consistency.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Cleaner Code: Adding Methods to Objects</h3>
          <h4>February 24, 2020</h4>
          <p>In my JS class, I've been building and erasing and rebuilding a quiz program to fully cement the process into my mind. While it's minorly distressing to erase code I've written, it's more worth it to write it over and over again as a means to getting better and better.
            <br><br>
          With this recent quiz program - I've built a Question function constructor to be used for the various questions within the quiz. Here's the bare bones of that constructor: </p>

            <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
  function Question(question, answers, 
  correctAnswer) {
    this.question = question;
    this.answers = answers;
    this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
  }</code>
  </pre><br>
          <p>When I get to the section of my program where I want to display a random question in my list of questions (I've left off the writing of these questions within this particular blog post, but just know that there are three different questions housed in an array, and they're accessed by a variable called random that makes use of the Math.floor, Math.random, and the questions' array length), I need to add a function called displayQuestion. <br><br>
          
          So, I could do the following to add the method to the Question object/function constructor as follows: </p><br>
<pre>
  <code>
function Question(question, answers, 
correctAnswer) {
  this.question = question;
  this.answers = answers;
  this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
  this.displayQuestion = function() {
   console.log(this.question);
        
   for (var i = 0; 
   i < this.answers.length; i++) {
     console.log(i + ': ' + 
     this.answers[i]);
   }
 }
}</code>
</pre><br>
   <p>The problem, though, is that it really isn't that clean or readable. So, the solution here would be to use the Object.prototype method to add the displayQuestion method to the Question constructor:</p><br>
   <pre>
    <code>
function Question(question, answers, 
correctAnswer) {
  this.question = question;
  this.answers = answers;
  this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
}
     
Question.prototype.displayQuestion = 
function() {
 console.log(this.question);
      
 for (var i = 0; i < this.answers.length; i++) {
   console.log(i + ': ' + 
   this.answers[i]);
 }}
    </code>
   </pre><br>
   <p>Now, we can clearly see that the displayQuestion method has been added to the Question function constructor. It wasn't totally necessary to add it in to the constructor itself. I like it!</p>
          <br><br>
      <h3>Faced with a Fork in the Road</h3>
          <h4>February 21, 2020</h4>
          <p>While I'm committed to improving my programming craft between jobs, I'm still keeping an eye out for any positions that look great. Most notably, if there's a great remote position that catches my eye, I'm happy to package up a nice little application and send it on its way.
            <br><br>
          While the main goal is to make a successful career transition into programming, I've also had my eye on more technical support roles (to make for a smooth transition from pure customer support to something more technical and eventually full programming).

            <br><br>
          My main struggle with this thinking, though, is - why continue with support when I have the chance to make a complete and total transition into programming? Am I thinking in terms of limiting myself? Am I letting this scarcity mentality reel me back in when I consider the amount of work I still need to put in to gain these skills?

            <br><br>
          The most difficult thing about it is the fact that my intuition is fully nudging me in the direction of working to become a full programmer. But I do want to work. I want to be a part of a team now. I want to continue on with my financial goals of fully paying off my student loans and investing in my future.
          <br><br>
          But I can't help but wonder if I'll end up letting the shorter-term job acquisition blur the truer, grittier goal of mastering my craft and launching head-first into the field of programming.

      <h3>Weekend Breaks from Coding</h3>
          <h4>February 18, 2020</h4>
          <p>It may seem counterintuitive to take breaks over the weekend when learning to code or when you're practicing to really improve your skills, but I've recently learned that taking a couple of solid days off from coding and mental gymnastics is such a cool thing.
            <br><br>
          Not only do you come back to your text editor on Monday with renewed motivation for getting back to your projects, but you also have this pool of creativity that almost seems to be bubbling over. What I mean is that those couple of days you gave your mind to take a rest gave it the opportunity to come up with so many great new ideas that you're excited to bring to your own coding practice when the time comes to sit down at your computer.
            <br><br>
          This past weekend, we took a break from the city and headed to the French countryside to be with Arthur's family. We relaxed, enjoyed great meals, drank champagne, and played Monopoly.
            <br><br>
          And from that, I got inspired to code up my own version of Monopoly! I've yet to start, but I can tell you my brain has already gotten started with mentally laying things out. Stay tuned for that!
          </p><br><br>
      <h3>Enlightened Self-Interest</h3>
          <h4>February 13, 2020</h4>
          <p>This quote serendipitously came into my life recently, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">Striving is fine, as long as it's tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don't waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome-- so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. <br> <p style="text-align: right;">- Dan Harris, 10% Happier </p> </p><br>

            <p>
            If this isn't something that inspires consistent action day after day after day, then I don't know what is. <br><br> Each time I come up against something that's really tough right at the beginning, I think of this quote just as my motivation starts to slip. And each time I do something a bit out of my comfort zone (apply to a job that's way out of my league, start in on a complicated side-project, or get rejected in any way), I think of this and of how important not being overly attached to the end result is. <br><br> 
            It's a bit like a 'what's the worst that could happen' reminder paired with the idea that everything always works out in the end - and it definitely gives me a healthy dose of perspective to keep on keepin' on.
          </p><br><br> 
      <h3>Learning is Not Linear</h3>
          <h4>February 12, 2020</h4>
          <p>Learning is not linear. It involves ups, downs, peaks, dips, plateaus, drops, rises, falls, rinses, and repeats.
            <br><br>
            Keep going, keep practicing, keep learning. One day in the near future, you'll be breezing through that which is stumping you today.
          </p><br><br>

      <h3>Better Coding: JavaScript Conditionals</h3>
      <h4>February 11, 2020</h4>
      <p>For my latest coding side project, <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/dice-game/" target="_blank">Dice
          Game</a> (adapted from my Jonas S. JS course on Udemy), one piece of the program's logic requires that rolling the die
        results in a variable holding a random number between 1 and 6. Depending on which number the variable logs,
        one of six images of the face of a die then shows up on the screen with a bit of nifty DOM manipulation.<br><br>

        When I was first writing out the code, my initial thought was to write out an if/else statement with all of the
        conditions of the random variable corresponding with each image of the face of the die, as follows: </p><br>
      <pre>
        <code>
  let dice = Math.floor(
    Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    
  let diceImage = 
  document.querySelector('.dice');
  diceImage.style.display = 'block';
     
  if (dice === 1) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-1.png';
  } else if (dice === 2) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-2.png';
  } else if (dice === 3) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-3.png';
     } else if (dice === 4) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-4.png';
   } else if (dice === 5) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-5.png';
  } else if (dice === 6) {
  diceImage.src = 'dice-6.png';
  }</code>
      </pre><br>
      <p>
        But then I learned that I could update the diceImage.src using type coercion by adding parts of the image name as a string with the corresponding image number sandwiched in between:
      </p>

      <br>
      <pre>
        <code>
  var diceImage = 
  document.querySelector('.dice');
  diceImage.style.display = 'block';
  diceImage.src = 'dice-' + dice + 
  '.png';</code>
      </pre><br>
      <p>
        Voilà! Three lines of code instead of sixteen!<br><br>
        
        It's things like this that make me really excited about JavaScript and its (and my!) capabilities. Not only are there a lot of cool programming concepts to keep learning, but there are also endless ways to make coding those programs more and more readable, clear, and effective.<br><br>
      </p><br><br>

      <h3>Make Time to Make Time</h3>
      <h4>February 6, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Yesterday I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK-sZjuXA6A" target="_blank">YouTube
          video</a> that was serendipitously recommended to me on my feed. I started to think about the idea of 'making
        time.' <br><br>
        Making time to take care of ourselves, making time to cook high-quality meals, making time to sit down and learn
        or code in a highly focused manner - instead of flying by and trying to get everything done in a 30-minute time
        slot.
        <br><br>
        This idea is great motivation for not simply checking every little thing off the to-do list in a very half-assed
        and not fully committed way, but instead, accomplishing bigger tasks that move the needle in a more significant
        way.
        <br><br>
        Along that same line, here's an excerpt I really love from Jason Fried's <a
          href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/compounding-time/" target="_blank">post</a> on the Signal vs Noise blog:
        <br><br>
        <p class="excerpt">There are lots of ways to carve up an hour. 10 x 6. 15 x 4. 30 x 2. 45 + 15. 20 + 20 + 20.
          The key is not to carve it up. And when you stack it up – one full hour after another – you really see the
          compound benefits of uninterrupted time. </p><br>
        <p>I love the idea of being able to fully complete any tasks we have on our plates by leveraging the power of
          truly uninterrupted time. I'm thinking of a task that we fear will take us the entire day, and then when we
          sit down to focus solely on that project, it ends up taking a true fraction of the expected time.<br><br>
          It really all starts with being mindful, and making the time, to do our best work and live our most enjoyable
          lives.

      <h3>Refactoring My Tip Calculator Program</h3>
      <h4>February 5, 2020</h4>
      <p>In one of my exercises from my JS course yesterday, we had to create an object, <code>john</code>, representing
        a person and the number and prices of meals he had on vacation and how much he tipped with each meal. According
        to instructions, he preferred to tip as follows: <br><br>
        - For meals less than $50, tip 20% <br>
        - For meals between $50 and $200, tip 15% <br>
        - For meals over $200, tip 10% (I know - I wouldn't want to be John's server either.) <br><br>

        Here's the code I started off with for calculating both the individual tips he gave for each meal, as well as
        each total meal cost (cost of meal with tip included): </p><br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
var john = {
  bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
  tips: [],
  totalMealCosts: [],
  calcTip: function(){
    var tip;
    var totalMealCost;
          
    for (let i = 0; 
    i < this.bills.length; i++) {
      var bill = this.bills[i];
      if (bill > 0 && bill < 50) {
        tip = bill * 0.2;
        totalMealCost = bill + tip;
      } else if (bill >= 50 && 
      bill <= 200) {
        tip = bill * 0.15;
        totalMealCost = bill + tip;
      } else {
        tip = bill * 0.1;
        totalMealCost = bill + tip;
      } 
      this.tips.push(tip);
    this.totalMealCosts.
    push(totalMealCost);
    } 
  }
 };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        And then after some refactoring, this is my final program (manually transpiled from ES5 to ES6):
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
  const john = {
    bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
    tips: [],
    totalMealCosts: [],
    calcTip: function(){
      let totalMealCost;
      let tipAmount;
      for (let i = 0; 
      i < this.bills.length; i++) {
        let bill = this.bills[i];
        let percentage;
         if (bill < 50) {
          percentage = 0.2;
        } else if (bill >= 50 && 
        bill <= 200) {
          percentage = 0.15;
        } else {
          percentage = 0.1;
        } 
          
      tipAmount = bill * percentage;
      totalMealCost = bill + tipAmount;

      this.tips.push(tipAmount);
      this.totalMealCosts.
      push(totalMealCost);
        } 
      }
    };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        The main thing here is the fact that I removed the tipAmount and totalMealCost variables from each tipping
        condition and moved them instead to the end of the for loop. <br><br>

        I'm working more on not repeating myself in my code, and I'm realizing that it all comes down to practicing and
        eventually reaching higher skill levels - after a certain amount of time, thinking about how your own code could
        be improved becomes as natural as anything.

      <h3>The Power of Learning Over and Over Again</h3>
      <h4>February 4, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I'm always overjoyed when something that I've been working on mastering/learning for some time finally settles
        in with that ephemeral <em>click.</em><br><br>

        Today I finished up the Basics section of my JavaScript course, and I'm very proud to say that I flew through it
        with soaring colors. I wish I could go back to my past self when she was just settling in to trying to figure
        out what JavaScript was, tap her on the shoulder, and let her know that everything was going to come full circle
        and click one of these days.<br><br>

        The secret is in putting in the effort day after day after day, even (and especially) when things aren't making
        sense. It takes learning something (like rock-solid JS foundations) over and over again before the concepts will
        seem familiar and - dare I say - enjoyable.<br><br>

        Proudest moments of the day:<br><br>

        - Fully understanding the use of the this keyword in multiple exercises <br>
        - Writing a solid, functional tip-calculating program from objects and methods
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>A Blog is Born</h3>
      <h4>February 3, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Here it is - the first official post of my self-developed portfolio and blog site! I'm still trying to wrap my
        head around dynamically rendering blog posts, so for now, I'm (embarrassingly) statically rendering them within
        the blog page. I feel like I'm on the brink of an idea and it involves pushing posts into an array that
        renders through DOM manipulation on the page. I know it would be a breeze with React or Gatsby, but for now I'm
        trying to focus solely on JS.<br><br>

        Speaking of which - I started in today on a JavaScript course on Udemy. I always love the beginnings of any JS
        lessons, books, etc. I'm pretty aware of how far I've come and I love being able to complete all the exercises
        with relative ease. Looking forward to spending these next couple of weeks focused on that and continuing to
        strengthen my JS foundation.<br><br>

        I'm hoping to document at least every day or two. I recently shipped a new side project - <a
          href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/three-todos/" target="_blank">Three To-Do's A Day</a>. I'll be updating some
        features and interactivity over the next few weeks, but I just love that feeling of publishing something (even
        when it's not completely perfect).
