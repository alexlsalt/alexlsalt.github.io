          <h3>The Weird Thing About Deleting Items from Lists in JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>March 5, 2020</h4>
          <p>When we create any type of program that includes functionality for adding and deleting items from a list on an app's interface, we need to pay extra attention to the features we include to delete items.
            <br><br>
          Before learning how to delete items off of lists, in my mind it seemed as simple as telling that specific item to delete itself from the DOM and it would disappear. But this is so wrong, and it really doesn't make any sense if you really think about it and have some JS experience under your belt.
            <br><br>
          Essentially, we can't just tell an item to delete itself. Instead, the deletion needs to be the responsibility of another related item. So, what we actually need is the item's parent element to do the deleting. Once we have access to that parent element, we can use the removeChild property to do so.
            <br><br>
          In other words, it's impossible to delete the item itself in JS, so we need to move up from the element to the parent node and then insert that same element to be removed into the removeChild property. Here's an example of that as a method of an object: </p> <br>
    <pre>
      <code>
        deleteListItem: function(selectorID) {

          document.getElementById(selectorID).parentNode
          .removeChild(document.getElementById(selectorID));
        }
      </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>And here's that same example after a bit of cleaning up/prettifying:</p><br>
    <pre>
      <code>
        deleteListItem: function(selectorID) {

          var element = document.getElementById(selectorID);

          element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
        }
     </code>
    </pre><br>
        <p>
          The end.
        </p><br><br>
          <h3>Getting Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable</h3>
          <h4>March 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>Something I continually think about is the idea/necessity of being comfortable with temporary discomfort when it comes to growth or leveling up in life. We can apply this simple yet effective concept to absolutely anything we come up against, and - instead of giving up just as the going gets tough - we can positively thrive over time and after getting more habituated to the discomfort.
            <br><br>
          I was in my Body Pump class at the gym yesterday that I try to get to twice a week. It kicks my butt - and it's certainly never comfortable in the moment - but I also find such motivation to push my body each time to get stronger. The routine stays the same for a few months, so it's easy to start getting used to what to expect each class, but it's also a great way to track your progress in terms of taking fewer breaks during the repititions or adding more weight to your bar.
            <br><br>
          Pushing through the hard parts when it's really freaking grueling is the ultimate sweet spot where you're pushing yourself to the next level.
            <br><br>
          And it's the same for me with coding. Day after day, I know that if I continue to show up and put in the work (which, let's face it, isn't comfortable the majority of the time), I'll get better and grow to be an all-around better developer.
            <br><br>
          Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is probably one of the best things we can do for ourselves under any circumstances when our goal is grow, improve, and ultimately master whatever we want to.
          </p><br><br>
        <h3>JavaScript Budget App Updates</h3>
          <h4>March 3, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday I made some major headway on my budget app (following along with building it via my JS course) in that I got all of the primary functionality working (i.e. entering incomes and expenses, making the calculations behind the scenes and also on the UI, etc).
            <br><br>
          What I'm now focusing on is the functionality behind deleting individual items from the list once they've been added as an income or expense. I've more or less done this before, but it's so great to go through it all in a very clear and well-explained manner - rather than relying on a few patched-together blog posts from various internet sources.
            <br><br>
          As mentioned before, my goal for this week is to get the app up and running and then to take it apart and rebuild it. I'll probably go through the course instructions again but this time with the foresight of knowing what comes next and all that good stuff. I'll probably also write out general notes for myself to help me when I eventually build it on my own without following along with the course. Reminder to self: learning is not linear.
            <br><br>
          I'm also currently building the app with three different modules as IIFEs (immediately invoked function expressions), but I'm looking forward to updating those as separate modules. The three modules are the budget controller (behind the scenes for the income and expense databases), the UI controller (responsible for any changes to the UI based on user interactions), and the app/global controller (responsible for connecting the budget controller and the UI controller, and for initializing the app).
          <br><br>
          I'm also getting a major lesson on code architecture and keeping everything organized. I'm learning about the importance of thinking about and writing out the structure of the program well before typing the first line of code. All really great stuff!
          </p><br><br> 

      <h3>Diving into March (and Coding)</h3>
      <h4>March 2, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Happy Monday and happy March! Starting off Month #3 of 2020 already - crazy, but in a good way! I personally feel great about it because in other times, each new month was accompanied by feelings of 'How the heck is it already March?!' and 'Time is passing me by and I don't even know where it's going!!'
        <br><br>
        From my previous post - I admittedly didn't get much coding done on Friday. I mentioned I try not to code on the weekends, but even on Friday it was tough for me to get in the zone - so I kind of didn't lol. I think I may have cracked open the text editor for an hour at best, added a new feature to the budget app I'm building along with my JS course, and called it a day.
        <br><br>
        But all in all, we're doin' quite alright, folks! Today I'm pretty tired, but I'm angling to get back into the coding mix. This week, my goal is to finish the budget app tutorial, and also to get really comfortable with it's structure and how the different modules of code fit together (still kind of mind-boggling, but I can feel those neurons firing upstairs!).
        <br><br>
        That way, next week, I can take it all apart and build it back up again! <br><br>

        So, as I prepare myself to dive back into all the code, here's a great quote I picked up from From Steven Pressfield's The War of Art this morning:
      </p><br><br>
      <p class="excerpt">
        There's no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our minds to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        In the interest of turning pro, I'm now heading into battle - despite the start-of-the-week drowsiness. Wish me luck! 
      </p>
      <br><br>
          <h3>Monday is the New Friday</h3>
          <h4>February 28, 2020</h4>
          <p>
          Something I've noticed over the past few weeks that I didn't realize before is the finite mental capacity we have each week. If we're going all-out day after day, it's recipe for burnout, loss of motivation, boredom - you know, all the fun stuff we simply assume is a just a necessary part of the work (hot take: it's not).
            <br><br>
          My week looks a little something like this: Monday through Friday, I spend anywhere from one to a few hours coding, learning - whatever it looks like to push me in the direction of where I want to be in the future. During those days, I give myself until around 6pm to do it, and if I don't - well, I just don't get my work done for that day (which I don't like, and which doesn't happen often, mind you).
            <br><br>
          After 6pm on weekdays, I dedicate my time to purely non-work activities - reading, spending time with my friends and loved ones, being outside, building a puzzle, watching Mad Men.
            <br><br>
          And then weekends, I don't code. I don't work. I don't stress out about sending in job applications or getting back to every email. Or at least I try my hardest not to. 
          <br><br>
          Weekends are sacred and restful. And this is a huge transition from how I treated off-time in the past. Before, I was going nonstop, pushing myself well past any limits that may have been there. Now, I have a healthy separation between work time and rest/play/decompress time.
          <br><br>
          Restful weekends and evenings allow for us to recharge and get excited about the work we get to dig in to the next day or week. When Friday rolls around, I can really feel the difference in my energy level compared to Monday when I was fresh and ready to roll. 
          <br><br>
          I love Fridays, but - dare I say - I think I may now love Mondays more.
          </p><br><br>
      <h3>The Unexpected Blessing of Being Out of Work</h3>
          <h4>February 27, 2020</h4>
          <p>Yesterday I was inspired by someone on Twitter proclaiming the improvements to her overall life despite being out of work and on the hunt for a new job. And I fully, completely agree.
            <br><br>
          Fortunately, in my final months at my last job (which I left at the end of 2019), I was able to really put my head down and save up a hefty living expense fund that's set to last me several months. I knew I wanted to make the transition to become a software developer, and I also knew that I didn't want to be rushed and at the end of my rope financially when it came to finding the perfect fit for my career.
            <br><br>
          In the two months that I've been unemployed, I've done so, so much. Not to mention, I'm probably in the best place I've been physically, mentally, and emotionally - maybe ever.
            <br><br>
          Giving myself the opportunity for a long runway definitely took some planning and sacrifice in the months leading up to it, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I currently spend my days working through my JavaScript learning process, building projects, applying to jobs only (!!) if they inspire me and make me feel like I'd like to be a part of the team, going to the park with my pup, reading (so much reading), getting regular wonderful exercise, and getting at least 8-9 hours of sleep every night.
          <br><br>
          As I was leafing through my copy of How To Be Parisian Wherever You Are (love this sassy little book!), this passage stood out to me, especially during this particular period of my life:</p><br><br>
          <p class="excerpt">Take the time to talk to the elderly lady next door, to read a book, to walk to work instead of riding the subway when it's a beautiful day. Take the time to escape for a weekend with friends. <br><br>
          Take the time to listen and to get to know yourself. Take the time to change, to grow, to rest. Take the time to say yes, take the time to say no. Take the time to look after your body, to eat well. Take the time to ask yourself who you are and what you want. <br><br>
          ... <br><br>
          Take the time to take time because nobody else will do it for you.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>So, in this beautiful, lingering period of being between jobs and in the midst of a major career transition, here's to doing just that.</p>
          <br><br> 
      <h3>'You Must Continue To...'</h3>
          <h4>February 26, 2020</h4>
          <p>Last weekend, I was set on attending a conference detailing the life of iconic artist, Frida Kahlo. I'd seen the announcement online and swiftly cancelled my normal Saturday morning Body Pump class at my gym in favor of a more cultural pursuit.
            <br><br>
          Lo and behold, after around an hour in line (it was suggested to arrive early due to limited seating), and just as I'd gained entrance into the building, we were told that capacity had been reached. Grrr!
            <br><br>
          Instead of regarding the morning as a failure, I had a backup plan, which included grabbing a latte from one of my favorite cafes, taking a seat on a sun-drenched bench on the bank of the river, and leafing through the copy of Crime and Punishment I'd brought with me (just in case, you know, there was a need for another plan).
            <br><br>
          When I got back home, I decided to watch a couple of short features about Kahlo's life anyway, and this quote from husband Diego Rivera to Kahlo after first viewing some of her early work struck a deep chord of inspiration:
          </p><br><br> 
          <p class="excerpt">In my opinion, no matter how difficult it may be for you,<br> you must continue to paint.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>I took this as a nudge for me to continue to code each and every day. Even (and especially) when it's difficult to feel the progress or when it seems like a certain concept has the least likely chance of clicking. 
          <br><br>
          Whatever it is you're trying to learn or build, stay the course. You must continue to do it - every single day. You'll be glad you did when you look back in the future and thank your past self for your tenacious consistency.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Cleaner Code: Adding Methods to Objects</h3>
          <h4>February 24, 2020</h4>
          <p>In my JS class, I've been building and erasing and rebuilding a quiz program to fully cement the process into my mind. While it's minorly distressing to erase code I've written, it's more worth it to write it over and over again as a means to getting better and better.
            <br><br>
          With this recent quiz program - I've built a Question function constructor to be used for the various questions within the quiz. Here's the bare bones of that constructor: </p>

            <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
    function Question(question, answers, 
    correctAnswer) {
      this.question = question;
      this.answers = answers;
      this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
    }</code>
  </pre><br>
          <p>When I get to the section of my program where I want to display a random question in my list of questions (I've left off the writing of these questions within this particular blog post, but just know that there are three different questions housed in an array, and they're accessed by a variable called random that makes use of the Math.floor, Math.random, and the questions' array length), I need to add a function called displayQuestion. <br><br>
          
          So, I could do the following to add the method to the Question object/function constructor as follows: </p><br>
  <pre>
    <code>
     function Question(question, answers, 
     correctAnswer) {
       this.question = question;
       this.answers = answers;
       this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
       this.displayQuestion = function() {
        console.log(this.question);
        
        for (var i = 0; i < this.answers.length; i++) {
          console.log(i + ': ' + this.answers[i]);
        }
      }
     }</code>
   </pre><br>
   <p>The problem, though, is that it really isn't that clean or readable. So, the solution here would be to use the Object.prototype method to add the displayQuestion method to the Question constructor:</p><br>
   <pre>
    <code>
     function Question(question, answers, 
     correctAnswer) {
       this.question = question;
       this.answers = answers;
       this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
     }
     
     Question.prototype.displayQuestion = function() {
      console.log(this.question);
      
      for (var i = 0; i < this.answers.length; i++) {
        console.log(i + ': ' + this.answers[i]);
      }
    }
    </code>
   </pre><br>
   <p>Now, we can clearly see that the displayQuestion method has been added to the Question function constructor. It wasn't totally necessary to add it in to the constructor itself. I like it!</p>
          <br><br>
      <h3>Faced with a Fork in the Road</h3>
          <h4>February 21, 2020</h4>
          <p>While I'm committed to improving my programming craft between jobs, I'm still keeping an eye out for any positions that look great. Most notably, if there's a great remote position that catches my eye, I'm happy to package up a nice little application and send it on its way.
            <br><br>
          While the main goal is to make a successful career transition into programming, I've also had my eye on more technical support roles (to make for a smooth transition from pure customer support to something more technical and eventually full programming).

            <br><br>
          My main struggle with this thinking, though, is - why continue with support when I have the chance to make a complete and total transition into programming? Am I thinking in terms of limiting myself? Am I letting this scarcity mentality reel me back in when I consider the amount of work I still need to put in to gain these skills?

            <br><br>
          The most difficult thing about it is the fact that my intuition is fully nudging me in the direction of working to become a full programmer. But I do want to work. I want to be a part of a team now. I want to continue on with my financial goals of fully paying off my student loans and investing in my future.
          <br><br>
          But I can't help but wonder if I'll end up letting the shorter-term job acquisition blur the truer, grittier goal of mastering my craft and launching head-first into the field of programming.

      <h3>Weekend Breaks from Coding</h3>
          <h4>February 18, 2020</h4>
          <p>It may seem counterintuitive to take breaks over the weekend when learning to code or when you're practicing to really improve your skills, but I've recently learned that taking a couple of solid days off from coding and mental gymnastics is such a cool thing.
            <br><br>
          Not only do you come back to your text editor on Monday with renewed motivation for getting back to your projects, but you also have this pool of creativity that almost seems to be bubbling over. What I mean is that those couple of days you gave your mind to take a rest gave it the opportunity to come up with so many great new ideas that you're excited to bring to your own coding practice when the time comes to sit down at your computer.
            <br><br>
          This past weekend, we took a break from the city and headed to the French countryside to be with Arthur's family. We relaxed, enjoyed great meals, drank champagne, and played Monopoly.
            <br><br>
          And from that, I got inspired to code up my own version of Monopoly! I've yet to start, but I can tell you my brain has already gotten started with mentally laying things out. Stay tuned for that!
          </p><br><br>
      <h3>Enlightened Self-Interest</h3>
          <h4>February 13, 2020</h4>
          <p>This quote serendipitously came into my life recently, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">Striving is fine, as long as it's tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don't waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome-- so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. <br> <p style="text-align: right;">- Dan Harris, 10% Happier </p> </p><br>

            <p>
            If this isn't something that inspires consistent action day after day after day, then I don't know what is. <br><br> Each time I come up against something that's really tough right at the beginning, I think of this quote just as my motivation starts to slip. And each time I do something a bit out of my comfort zone (apply to a job that's way out of my league, start in on a complicated side-project, or get rejected in any way), I think of this and of how important not being overly attached to the end result is. <br><br> 
            It's a bit like a 'what's the worst that could happen' reminder paired with the idea that everything always works out in the end - and it definitely gives me a healthy dose of perspective to keep on keepin' on.
          </p><br><br> 
      <h3>Learning is Not Linear</h3>
          <h4>February 12, 2020</h4>
          <p>Learning is not linear. It involves ups, downs, peaks, dips, plateaus, drops, rises, falls, rinses, and repeats.
            <br><br>
            Keep going, keep practicing, keep learning. One day in the near future, you'll be breezing through that which is stumping you today.
          </p><br><br>

      <h3>Better Coding: JavaScript Conditionals</h3>
      <h4>February 11, 2020</h4>
      <p>For my latest coding side project, <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/dice-game/" target="_blank">Dice
          Game</a> (adapted from my Jonas S. JS course on Udemy), one piece of the program's logic requires that rolling the die
        results in a variable holding a random number between 1 and 6. Depending on which number the variable logs,
        one of six images of the face of a die then shows up on the screen with a bit of nifty DOM manipulation.<br><br>

        When I was first writing out the code, my initial thought was to write out an if/else statement with all of the
        conditions of the random variable corresponding with each image of the face of the die, as follows: </p><br>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let dice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    
    let diceImage = document.querySelector('.dice');
    diceImage.style.display = 'block';
     
    if (dice === 1) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-1.png';
    } else if (dice === 2) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-2.png';
    } else if (dice === 3) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-3.png';
      } else if (dice === 4) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-4.png';
     } else if (dice === 5) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-5.png';
    } else if (dice === 6) {
    diceImage.src = 'dice-6.png';
    }</code>
      </pre><br>
      <p>
        But then I learned that I could update the diceImage.src using type coercion by adding parts of the image name as a string with the corresponding image number sandwiched in between:
      </p>

      <br>
      <pre>
        <code>

        Voilà! Three lines of code instead of sixteen!<br><br>
        
        It's things like this that make me really excited about JavaScript and its (and my!) capabilities. Not only are there a lot of cool programming concepts to keep learning, but there are also endless ways to make coding those programs more and more readable, clear, and effective.<br><br>

      <h3>Make Time to Make Time</h3>
      <h4>February 6, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Yesterday I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK-sZjuXA6A" target="_blank">YouTube
          video</a> that was serendipitously recommended to me on my feed. I started to think about the idea of 'making
        time.' <br><br>
        Making time to take care of ourselves, making time to cook high-quality meals, making time to sit down and learn
        or code in a highly focused manner - instead of flying by and trying to get everything done in a 30-minute time
        slot.
        <br><br>
        This idea is great motivation for not simply checking every little thing off the to-do list in a very half-assed
        and not fully committed way, but instead, accomplishing bigger tasks that move the needle in a more significant
        way.
        <br><br>
        Along that same line, here's an excerpt I really love from Jason Fried's <a
          href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/compounding-time/" target="_blank">post</a> on the Signal vs Noise blog:
        <br><br>
        <p class="excerpt">There are lots of ways to carve up an hour. 10 x 6. 15 x 4. 30 x 2. 45 + 15. 20 + 20 + 20.
          The key is not to carve it up. And when you stack it up – one full hour after another – you really see the
          compound benefits of uninterrupted time. </p><br>
        <p>I love the idea of being able to fully complete any tasks we have on our plates by leveraging the power of
          truly uninterrupted time. I'm thinking of a task that we fear will take us the entire day, and then when we
          sit down to focus solely on that project, it ends up taking a true fraction of the expected time.<br><br>
          It really all starts with being mindful, and making the time, to do our best work and live our most enjoyable
          lives.

      <h3>Refactoring My Tip Calculator Program</h3>
      <h4>February 5, 2020</h4>
      <p>In one of my exercises from my JS course yesterday, we had to create an object, <code>john</code>, representing
        a person and the number and prices of meals he had on vacation and how much he tipped with each meal. According
        to instructions, he preferred to tip as follows: <br><br>
        - For meals less than $50, tip 20% <br>
        - For meals between $50 and $200, tip 15% <br>
        - For meals over $200, tip 10% (I know - I wouldn't want to be John's server either.) <br><br>

        Here's the code I started off with for calculating both the individual tips he gave for each meal, as well as
        each total meal cost (cost of meal with tip included): </p><br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
      var john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          var tip;
          var totalMealCost;
          
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            var bill = this.bills[i];
            if (bill > 0 && bill < 50) {
              tip = bill * 0.2;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              tip = bill * 0.15;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else {
              tip = bill * 0.1;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } 
          this.tips.push(tip);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
          } 
        }
      };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        And then after some refactoring, this is my final program (manually transpiled from ES5 to ES6):
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
      const john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          let totalMealCost;
          let tipAmount;
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            let bill = this.bills[i];
            let percentage;
             if (bill < 50) {
              percentage = 0.2;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              percentage = 0.15;
            } else {
              percentage = 0.1;
            } 
          
          tipAmount = bill * percentage;
          totalMealCost = bill + tipAmount;

          this.tips.push(tipAmount);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
           } 
         }
       };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        The main thing here is the fact that I removed the tipAmount and totalMealCost variables from each tipping
        condition and moved them instead to the end of the for loop. <br><br>

        I'm working more on not repeating myself in my code, and I'm realizing that it all comes down to practicing and
        eventually reaching higher skill levels - after a certain amount of time, thinking about how your own code could
        be improved becomes as natural as anything.

      <h3>The Power of Learning Over and Over Again</h3>
      <h4>February 4, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I'm always overjoyed when something that I've been working on mastering/learning for some time finally settles
        in with that ephemeral <em>click.</em><br><br>

        Today I finished up the Basics section of my JavaScript course, and I'm very proud to say that I flew through it
        with soaring colors. I wish I could go back to my past self when she was just settling in to trying to figure
        out what JavaScript was, tap her on the shoulder, and let her know that everything was going to come full circle
        and click one of these days.<br><br>

        The secret is in putting in the effort day after day after day, even (and especially) when things aren't making
        sense. It takes learning something (like rock-solid JS foundations) over and over again before the concepts will
        seem familiar and - dare I say - enjoyable.<br><br>

        Proudest moments of the day:<br><br>

        - Fully understanding the use of the this keyword in multiple exercises <br>
        - Writing a solid, functional tip-calculating program from objects and methods
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>A Blog is Born</h3>
      <h4>February 3, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Here it is - the first official post of my self-developed portfolio and blog site! I'm still trying to wrap my
        head around dynamically rendering blog posts, so for now, I'm (embarrassingly) statically rendering them within
        the blog.html page. I feel like I'm on the brink of an idea and it involves pushing posts into an array that
        renders through DOM manipulation on the page. I know it would be a breeze with React or Gatsby, but for now I'm
        trying to focus solely on JS.<br><br>

        Speaking of which - I started in today on a JavaScript course on Udemy. I always love the beginnings of any JS
        lessons, books, etc. I'm pretty aware of how far I've come and I love being able to complete all the exercises
        with relative ease. Looking forward to spending these next couple of weeks focused on that and continuing to
        strengthen my JS foundation.<br><br>

        I'm hoping to document at least every day or two. I recently shipped a new side project - <a
          href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/three-todos/" target="_blank">Three To-Do's A Day</a>. I'll be updating some
        features and interactivity over the next few weeks, but I just love that feeling of publishing something (even
        when it's not completely perfect).
