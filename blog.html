      <h3>Enlightened Self-Interest</h3>
          <h4>February 13, 2020</h4>
          <p>This quote serendipitously came into my life recently, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="excerpt">Striving is fine, as long as it's tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don't waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome-- so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. <br> <p style="text-align: right;">- Dan Harris, 10% Happier </p> </p><br>

            <p>
            If this isn't something that inspires consistent action day after day after day, then I don't know what is. <br><br> Each time I come up against something that's really tough right at the beginning, I think of this quote just as my motivation starts to slip. And each time I do something a bit out of my comfort zone (apply to a job that's way out of my league, start in on a complicated side-project, or get rejected in any way), I think of this and of how important not being overly attached to the end result is. <br><br> 
            It's a bit like a 'what's the worst that could happen' reminder paired with the idea that everything always works out in the end - and it definitely gives me a healthy dose of perspective to keep on keepin' on.

      <h3>Learning is Not Linear</h3>
          <h4>February 12, 2020</h4>
          <p>Learning is not linear. It involves ups, downs, peaks, dips, plateaus, drops, rises, falls, rinses, and repeats.
            <br><br>
            Keep going, keep practicing, keep learning. One day in the near future, you'll be breezing through that which is stumping you today.

      <h3>Better Coding: JavaScript Conditionals</h3>
      <h4>February 11, 2020</h4>
      <p>For my latest coding side project, <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/dice-game/" target="_blank">Dice
          Game</a> (adapted from my Jonas S. JS course on Udemy), one piece of the program's logic requires that rolling the die
        results in a variable holding a random number between 1 and 6. Depending on which number the variable logs,
        one of six images of the face of a die then shows up on the screen with a bit of nifty DOM manipulation.<br><br>

        When I was first writing out the code, my initial thought was to write out an if/else statement with all of the
        conditions of the random variable corresponding with each image of the face of the die, as follows: </p><br>
      <pre>
        <code>
      let dice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
      
      let diceImage = document.querySelector('.dice');
      diceImage.style.display = 'block';
      
      if (dice === 1) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-1.png';
      } else if (dice === 2) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-2.png';
      } else if (dice === 3) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-3.png';
      } else if (dice === 4) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-4.png';
      } else if (dice === 5) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-5.png';
      } else if (dice === 6) {
      diceImage.src = 'dice-6.png';
      }</code>
      </pre><br>
      <p>
        But then I learned that I could update the diceImage.src using type coercion by adding parts of the image name as a string with the corresponding image number sandwiched in between:
      </p>

      <br>
      <pre>
        <code>
      var diceImage = document.querySelector('.dice');
      diceImage.style.display = 'block';
      diceImage.src = 'dice-' + dice + '.png';</code>
      </pre><br>
      <p>
        Voilà! Three lines of code instead of sixteen!<br><br>
        
        It's things like this that make me really excited about JavaScript and its (and my!) capabilities. Not only are there a lot of cool programming concepts to keep learning, but there are also endless ways to make coding those programs more and more readable, clear, and effective.<br><br>
      </p><br><br>

      <h3>Make Time to Make Time</h3>
      <h4>February 6, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Yesterday I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK-sZjuXA6A" target="_blank">YouTube
          video</a> that was serendipitously recommended to me on my feed. I started to think about the idea of 'making
        time.' <br><br>
        Making time to take care of ourselves, making time to cook high-quality meals, making time to sit down and learn
        or code in a highly focused manner - instead of flying by and trying to get everything done in a 30-minute time
        slot.
        <br><br>
        This idea is great motivation for not simply checking every little thing off the to-do list in a very half-assed
        and not fully committed way, but instead, accomplishing bigger tasks that move the needle in a more significant
        way.
        <br><br>
        Along that same line, here's an excerpt I really love from Jason Fried's <a
          href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/compounding-time/" target="_blank">post</a> on the Signal vs Noise blog:
        <br><br>
        <p class="excerpt">There are lots of ways to carve up an hour. 10 x 6. 15 x 4. 30 x 2. 45 + 15. 20 + 20 + 20.
          The key is not to carve it up. And when you stack it up – one full hour after another – you really see the
          compound benefits of uninterrupted time. </p><br>
        <p>I love the idea of being able to fully complete any tasks we have on our plates by leveraging the power of
          truly uninterrupted time. I'm thinking of a task that we fear will take us the entire day, and then when we
          sit down to focus solely on that project, it ends up taking a true fraction of the expected time.<br><br>
          It really all starts with being mindful, and making the time, to do our best work and live our most enjoyable
          lives.

      <h3>Refactoring My Tip Calculator Program</h3>
      <h4>February 5, 2020</h4>
      <p>In one of my exercises from my JS course yesterday, we had to create an object, <code>john</code>, representing
        a person and the number and prices of meals he had on vacation and how much he tipped with each meal. According
        to instructions, he preferred to tip as follows: <br><br>
        - For meals less than $50, tip 20% <br>
        - For meals between $50 and $200, tip 15% <br>
        - For meals over $200, tip 10% (I know - I wouldn't want to be John's server either.) <br><br>

        Here's the code I started off with for calculating both the individual tips he gave for each meal, as well as
        each total meal cost (cost of meal with tip included): </p><br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
      var john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          var tip;
          var totalMealCost;
          
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            var bill = this.bills[i];
            if (bill > 0 && bill < 50) {
              tip = bill * 0.2;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              tip = bill * 0.15;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } else {
              tip = bill * 0.1;
              totalMealCost = bill + tip;
            } 
          this.tips.push(tip);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
          } 
        }
      };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        And then after some refactoring, this is my final program (manually transpiled from ES5 to ES6):
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <pre>
              <code>
      const john = {
        bills: [124, 48, 268, 180, 42],
        tips: [],
        totalMealCosts: [],
        calcTip: function(){
          let totalMealCost;
          let tipAmount;
          for (let i = 0; i < this.bills.length; i++) {
            let bill = this.bills[i];
            let percentage;
             if (bill < 50) {
              percentage = 0.2;
            } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
              percentage = 0.15;
            } else {
              percentage = 0.1;
            } 
          
          tipAmount = bill * percentage;
          totalMealCost = bill + tipAmount;

          this.tips.push(tipAmount);
          this.totalMealCosts.push(totalMealCost);
           } 
         }
       };</code>
            </pre><br><br>
      <p>
        The main thing here is the fact that I removed the tipAmount and totalMealCost variables from each tipping
        condition and moved them instead to the end of the for loop. <br><br>

        I'm working more on not repeating myself in my code, and I'm realizing that it all comes down to practicing and
        eventually reaching higher skill levels - after a certain amount of time, thinking about how your own code could
        be improved becomes as natural as anything.
        <br><br>

      <h3>The Power of Learning Over and Over Again</h3>
      <h4>February 4, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I'm always overjoyed when something that I've been working on mastering/learning for some time finally settles
        in with that ephemeral <em>click.</em><br><br>

        Today I finished up the Basics section of my JavaScript course, and I'm very proud to say that I flew through it
        with soaring colors. I wish I could go back to my past self when she was just settling in to trying to figure
        out what JavaScript was, tap her on the shoulder, and let her know that everything was going to come full circle
        and click one of these days.<br><br>

        The secret is in putting in the effort day after day after day, even (and especially) when things aren't making
        sense. It takes learning something (like rock-solid JS foundations) over and over again before the concepts will
        seem familiar and - dare I say - enjoyable.<br><br>

        Proudest moments of the day:<br><br>

        - Fully understanding the use of the this keyword in multiple exercises <br>
        - Writing a solid, functional tip-calculating program from objects and methods
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>A Blog is Born</h3>
      <h4>February 3, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Here it is - the first official post of my self-developed portfolio and blog site! I'm still trying to wrap my
        head around dynamically rendering blog posts, so for now, I'm (embarrassingly) statically rendering them within
        the blog.html page. I feel like I'm on the brink of an idea and it involves pushing posts into an array that
        renders through DOM manipulation on the page. I know it would be a breeze with React or Gatsby, but for now I'm
        trying to focus solely on JS.<br><br>

        Speaking of which - I started in today on a JavaScript course on Udemy. I always love the beginnings of any JS
        lessons, books, etc. I'm pretty aware of how far I've come and I love being able to complete all the exercises
        with relative ease. Looking forward to spending these next couple of weeks focused on that and continuing to
        strengthen my JS foundation.<br><br>

        I'm hoping to document at least every day or two. I recently shipped a new side project - <a
          href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/three-todos/" target="_blank">Three To-Do's A Day</a>. I'll be updating some
        features and interactivity over the next few weeks, but I just love that feeling of publishing something (even
        when it's not completely perfect).
