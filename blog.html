          <h3>The Power of Learning Over and Over</h3>
          <h4>February 4, 2020</h4>
          <p>
            I'm always overjoyed when something that I've been working on mastering/learning for some time finally settles in with that ephemeral <em>click.</em><br><br>

            Today I finished up the Basics section of my JavaScript course, and I'm very proud to say that I flew through it with soaring colors. I wish I could go back to my past self when she was just settling in to trying to figure out what JavaScript was, tap her on the shoulder, and let her know that everything was going to come full circle and click one of these days.<br><br>

            The secret is in putting in the effort day after day after day, even (and especially) when things aren't making sense. It takes learning something (like rock-solid JS foundations) over and over again before the concepts will seem familiar and - dare I say - enjoyable.<br><br>

            Proudest moments of the day:<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Fully understanding the use of the this keyword in multiple exercises</li>
              <li>Writing a solid, functional tip-calculating program from objects and methods</li>
            </ul>
          </p><br><br>
        
          <h3>A Blog is Born</h3>
          <h4>February 3, 2020</h4>
          <p>
            Here it is - the first official post of my self-developed portfolio and blog site! I'm still trying to wrap my head around dynamically rendering blog posts, so for now, I'm (embarrassingly) statically rendering them within the blog.html page. I feel like I'm on the brink of an idea and it involves pushing posts into an array that renders through DOM manipulation on the page. I know it would be a breeze with React or Gatsby, but for now I'm trying to focus solely on JS.<br><br>

            Speaking of which - I started in today on a JavaScript course on Udemy. I always love the beginnings of any JS lessons, books, etc. I'm pretty aware of how far I've come and I love being able to complete all the exercises with relative ease. Looking forward to spending these next couple of weeks focused on that and continuing to strengthen my JS foundation.<br><br>

            I'm hoping to document at least every day or two. I recently shipped a new side project - <a href="https://alexlsalt.github.io/three-todos/" target="_blank">Three To-Do's A Day</a>. I'll be updating some features and interactivity over the next few weeks, but I just love that feeling of publishing something (even when it's not completely perfect).
